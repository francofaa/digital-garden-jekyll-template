title: Grandmother Nervepeelers spellbook

A book of spells (containing Bheur hag spells and love letters to Natalya)

> You find among the spells, letters written in three different hands. Upon further inspection, you can read that these are love letters, written in an archaic form, but still intelligible. They are from three different men, signed Temarian, Yoldo, and Sull. Each pines for the subject of the letter, Natalya. There is seemingly an order to these letters, each more desperate and maddened than the last, and they all seem unrequited.
