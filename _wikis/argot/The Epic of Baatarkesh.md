title: The Epic of Baatarkesh
---
> As you flip through the book, you read poetry, a classic legend called the Epic of Baatarkesh, retold a dozen times, but it slowly dawns on you: This is the original version of that story, from 600 years ago. Long thought to have been lost, this epic is here in your hands, as it was when it was first written down. In the middle of the book, you find 20 pages partially erased and written over with alchemical formulas and a note at the end of the 20 pages. It reads:
> 
> Dearest Arry,
> 
> This is a formula for fun and profit! The Hidimba and I have been getting along quite well, though he always looks at me as though he wants to bite my head off. Maybe itâ€™s just the panther face. At any rate, these formulas will give your troops a much-needed boost to their weapons. The Hidimba assures me that there are no side-effects here.

> Yours,

> Nat
