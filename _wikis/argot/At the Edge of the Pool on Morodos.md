# At the Edge of the Pool on Morodos

Our heroes made a tactical strike on the cunning women of Quebra, with an all-star performance by Livius and a classic duck transformation from Mallory. Abe once again did not witness Livius's competence. They recovered the Monograph on the Study of Elixirs Made from Sirablood and a silver mirror. The Alchemist derived a recipe and the gang leveled up. Mallory robbed an herbalist. 

The Kodama gifted them a second level charm rune. 

They got the Quebra timber across the sea to Lemba. The ship upgrade will be ready in one week. 

In the meantime, the gang borrowed two swan-boats and arrived at Morodos and met a fish-man named Glub. He and his people sold the heroes some weapons and some food.Â  The gang was brought to a pool in a cove, and Glub requested that the heroes go in, eliminate the snake people to restore the fish-people's fishing spot, and claim the treasure. 

You stand at the edge of the water, ready with a water-breathing charm and a dream of treasure. 

Please note: You must use whatever rations, food you can forage, and food you can buy while you are away from the P.S. Admirable Effort. The ship will continue to consume their rations and their only protection 

24 days to the arrival of Zulon

7 days since the battle on Aurochs Island, the first engagement of the Mineosi-Argotian War

You have found treasure! \

# Lava tubes

The heroes swam through the lava tubes before surfacing in a den of snake-people. The heroes fought valiantly, with Sora making a risky move by burning Abraham (which Livius took the blame for), Hobbes saving Abraham's life from the abomination, and the heroes nearly getting vanquished by sleep before Livius blasted the last two monsters standing (which a delirious Abe also missed).

Mallory, with Sora's help, solved the door puzzle, because the door wasn't a door without its handle. The heroes came up with a clever plan, after Mallory scouted out the situation. Unfortunately Mallory could not find a tadpole inside the Maw as it legendarily resisted the wizard's signature move. 

Casimir redeemed himself by shooting the Maw through the eye and killing it. The heroes found themselves scrambling to rescue Abraham and bring him home to his beloved Baltsaros. With Sora and Casimir's quick thinking, they were able to stabilize him. A blast of radiation and lightning from Livius unfortunately went unnoticed by Abraham as Livius felled one of the sharks. Nahk did his best to fend off another of the sharks but nearly got Abraham'd

The heroes then spent an hour or so just pot-shotting the sharks below until they found a clear path to the treasure trove below. 

Still the same amount of days to Zulon! He's a toothy boy and excited to see you guys again. Just to remind you, he doesn't dislike you. He is just excited to come to the material plane with an army of his closest friends and meet some mortals. No big.

* There is a massive pile of silver coins at the bottom of this cavern, like an unwieldy amount of coins, 400 pounds (20,000 silver coins). 
* 5 potions of healing
* 5 rocks of devils ore
* 3 [harpoons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1585772-harpoon) (spear, on range attack: if the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a Strength contest against the attacker or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the attacker)
* [Boots of Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/boots-of-speed)
* [Fey Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1457853-fey-blade)

Fight over it and figure out how to get it and yourselves out of the caverns. Let me know if you have any trouble with the links to the homebrew items. 

There are also three little kodamas down here, breathing water apparently, standing on the corpse of the big Maw shark. The one in front hands you a grade-1 spiral charm and says its [rhyme](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WuwYmmvQxiOLZe-IlVYPpcTa-iuugK0vxgK3BrRSUSQ/edit#) again, but with nine left to stitch. Wow single digits, who'd'a thought. 

You do not find a book! And no, you do not level up! Sorry, just gotta get ahead of that.
