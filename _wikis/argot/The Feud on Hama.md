# The Feud on Hama

*From Selena at Tawnytown, populated by the descendants of Aramestes’s followers*

> The Hidimba is very dangerous. Aramestes was just a scholar, seeking truth. But the gods and devils do not like it when us mere mortals attempt to reach beyond our grasp. But look at what the devil has done! Banished us all, even his own followers. They say the Hidimba’s vengeance knows no end. That he will destroy and torture every generation of descendants of those who have failed him or killed him. The vengeance here among the isles has been truly thorough. But I believe Aramestes survived.
>
> My mother told me the story of when we were cut out of the world. She was a kitten when it happened, and we are long-lived. The elders later told her of what happened to my grandmother.
>
> My grandmother Xelena studied with Aramestes and spied for him, getting into the Hidimba’s good graces. She ventured into the jungle after she heard of some strange ritual the Hidimba was going to perform, to try to stop him. But she died there. A strange light emerged from the cloudy peaks, a flash, and we were gone.
>
> Do you know what became of them?

*From Thea at Catervillage, populated by the descendants of the Hidimba’s followers*

> The Hidimba had to take extraordinary measures to defeat Aramestes. He was doing unnatural things. The Hidimba may have been an Outsider, but he was only try to stop a man from reaching beyond his grasp. At least Aramestes was defeated. The Hidimba will be back for us.
>
> He must come back for us.
>
> Xelena, my grandmother, was a spy for the Hidimba, working with Aramestes to undermine him. She went into the jungles to perform that final, necessary curse to end Aramestes’s reign. For the greater good. But the Hidimba will be back for us. We who were so loyal.

> But do you know of Aramestes. If you come from the outside. What became of him in the rest of the world?
