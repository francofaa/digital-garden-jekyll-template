title: Fornorio
---

Fornorio was a shell for [[The Ambassador]]. One of the earliest shells, when he was freed during [[My Dinner with Hespero]], he revealed that he was centuries old and fought alongside [[Theo]] and [[Hamiltonos Washington]], who were hurtled into the future in the maze under Aurochs Island.

His last known location was Hespero's mansion, in his dungeons. 

The Burr, which he and his friend slew, lived 65 years ago in Varak. 

> He lived lavishly and controlled the city for years, until my mother tried to stand up to him. She was jealous of his wealth and wanted it for her own. In spite of her poor reasons, the Burr was revealed to us for what he was in truth: a fiend from another realm. My friends and I trained until we were powerful enough to slay him.
