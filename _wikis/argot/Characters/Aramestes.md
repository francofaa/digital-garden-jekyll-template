An Archmage who used to study under [[The Hidimba]]. Aramestes led a war against the Hidimba in the 14 Islands to seize and steal his power. (The Hidimba later severed 13 of these islands into a demiplane, trapping [[Natalya]], Aramestes's sister, in Aurochs Island). 

Aramestes later became [[The Lich of the Godsbody]], working together with [[The Burr]], who was the next incarnation of [[The Hidimba]]. Their efforts to control the Argolosi Peninsula were thwarted by [[Fornorio]], [[Hamiltonos Washington]], and [[Theo]], though they came to an ultimately worse end. 

Aramestes later went to Mineos and over the course of a century took over the country and became [[The Deathless One]].
