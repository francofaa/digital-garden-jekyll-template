# Arch-Lich Goromus (Osteros)

Entering the crypt of Arch-Lich Goromus: 

> When the wall slides open, you behold a chamber. The voice from above announces, “Behold, my true treasure trove! Marvel upon it and weep, foolish mortals, for I am the great Lich Goromus, the undying!” All around you are the bodies of 12 creatures, identical, gray-faced and withered. Their heavy robes make them look even smaller and more pathetic. Cobwebs, dust, and sand cover this room. “But you shall never leave with it!”
>
> The door seals behind you. In the center of room, you realize there is a figure, turned away from you, crouched over with a lantern. Spent vials of sirablood are scattered around its feet. It is the only source of light in the room, but allows you to see 12 bodies in the room.
>
> “Just wait! I almost have it!”
>
> The creature turns to look at you. You see a skeletal creature, muscle still clinging to its body, red and gruesome. From its skull you can tell that it was a Dragonborn in life. It points a finger at you each in turn, its claws long and deformed, each finger as long as its leg.
