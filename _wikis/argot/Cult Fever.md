# Embassy Sweets and Sandos

The gang meets Armand and Sora at Hespero’s shop. Armand contracts the gang to find his son, Taedor. The gang runs and seeks out a caravan on the way. A man misleads them into thinking the caravan is going straight to Varak.

The gang gets attacked by a snake, comes across a goatherd, fights a giant boar, and reaches the caravan, using boar meat to negotiate through situations.

Sora meets Slavos, a young musician from Argot. The gang gets to the farmland outside of Kraikos and are ambushed by some scarecrows. They cause a fire and the farmer is very mean to them. A rude man accosts them and is suddenly murdered and then pickpocketed by white-eyed children.

Benfred approaches them and offers a place to stay. Casamir turns into a cat and hides in a cranny. The gang agrees to stay at the inn. They suspect that the bad vibes in the village which started 12 years ago are because of a hag. Millie reveals her daughter was kidnapped.

Sora, overnight, is haunted, as she slept alone in her room, by the visions of Kriv and her boss Ralos. She takes a hit point loss after having bad nightmares.

Benfred spoke of a priest up in the hills and a vineyard.

The gang leaves. Sora keeps hearing a melody from the woods, but they ignore it and roll up to the Embassy. The Ambassador talks to them and lures them into the embassy. Casamir and Abraham stay outside in the courtyard.

Sora regains her lost hit points, talks to a countryman from Werriad, and Livius invents the sandwich.

# Catuesque

The gang arrives in Varak. They are fleeced by the racist Jimmy and take a gondola along with Dorice and two others. Sora robs the gondolier and the gang arrives at the burnt out temple of Diana.

Abe accosts the incense bearers and they get mad and try to force them out. The gang does not engage in the fight and the priest is easily handling Abe.

The group eventually makes their way back into the temple by various means and watch as the angel appears. Everyone is chanting and in a trance of some kind (sincere religious trance) and Dorice is chosen because the gang asks them to choose her. The angel agrees and Dorice convulses on the ground, the world turns black, and she and the angel disappear.

Sora witnesses a strange winged creature flying off into the distance. Sora, disguised as a novice, talks to the priest and learns vaguely where the compound is.

The gang goes to Nana Mike’s where Livius sleeps with Nana Mike. The next morning Livius uses his find familiar to track the angel.

After hours and hours of wandering the woods, and after an encounter with a rusalka which downs Livius and then escapes in a puddle of water, and a cave of wolves, a dead body in the woods, a dryad, the owl comes back and reports.

The next day the owl takes the gang to the compound. It is the second day since they departed.

The gang arrives in the compound. Abe and a mute Sora talk their way into the compound to meet Sofronia. Cas tries to climb the fence but falls and hurts himself a lot. Liv gets discovered by some cultists and disguises himself in their garb.

Cas discovers that the bull is used to kill people. Sofronia takes the gang to see Taedor and Abe does a smoke bomb and tries to extricate Taedor and the rest of them. Sofronia does not let her disguise show through but she is able to fight them ok.

The gang runs away with Taedor, Sofronia reveals her true form, Liv is charmed, Sofronia lets the gang escape.

## From the Notes of Abraham Washington

As the former employees of Hespiro look for more information about this Cult of the Angel, the find a gondola going out to an old, worn-down temple to Diana. The gondolaneer is a cantankerous old racist who charges the heroes four times as much gold to get to the temple than he does to anyone else. The party is displeased but pay the extortisionist anyway as they have things they need to do. While riding down the canal streets, Abraham meets a young elf child named Doresse. This pitiful child's tale of suffering and woe reminds him of his own early childhood and he sets his mind on trying to protect the girl and get her healed. As a bit of karmic balance at the end of the journey, Sora, the beautiful and dangerous dragonborn bodyguard of some dude we met awhile back, got a stealth fingered discount on the gold pieces and returned what the party had been forced to pay back to each person.

Meeting the folks who were also gathered on the island went less than spectacalurly for our intrepid journey men (and lady). Due to a misunderstanding with some priests Abraham was forced, FORCED, into an altercation with the leader of the Angelic Cult. The man was Xanathos and he did not like being asked questions about his faith even if they were perfectly innocent questions by those who were new to the faith. Abraham was abandoned by the catuesque Chaz who hid beneath a bench and his lovely Zasou who fled outside. Only Levi stayed in the room, but at least he blundered into one of the priests and broke his foot. Overcome by the dark magic of the cult, Abraham ran outside to meet with Zasou.

Sensing a weakness diplomacy could exploit, Abraham bravely denounced his association with the others allowing the elf child to stay safe. The priest in their callousness were willing to cast her out as well, killing her in their negligence. Knowing now for certain these are evil men Abraham vowed to himself to bring them all down before he set foot on the road out of Varock.

Having had to leave the island and travel to the mainland the heroes picked up shelter at a local inn. The keep was a woman named Nana Mike, and the chemisty she had with Levi was palpable and electrified the air between the two. They engaged in a dance of words and body language that could only be described as a transcendental ballet. They disappeared into each other and the individuals only resurfaced after the sun and warmed the morning dew away. Truly, love blossoms in the most unusal places. It did my heart good to see.

From there the heroes paraded down the paths into the woods following the whisper of a form we witnessed flying from the Temple of Diana into the wilds beyond Varock. Our way was detoured when I heard the sobbing of a maiden off the trail. Racing to the aid of an innocent in trouble, I saw her there blue skinned and half drowned and tried to pull her our of the water into safety. The demon attacking her also made a grab for me and lucky I was indeed that Levi and Zasou were there to fire their magics and steel at the demon. Chaz landed a blow that sent the demon bubbling down to the depths taking with it the poor, innocent maiden as well. I cursed myself for my failure, but these tragedies are part of an adventurers life and we had to shoulder on to our main goal.

The road was long but eventually a friendly owl tooks us to a spot where we could wait until it scouted out the area and bring us back information about the citadel where the "chosen" of the angel Malthematic were "allowed" to "live" in "peace" and "happiness". I found a cave nearby that we could have slept in, but a preliminary search revelaed it was already occupied by a family of wolves. They followed me out and our group was forced to adhere the Law of the Wild, kill or be killed. After this unpleasentness was handled, Chaz told us all of an old woman who had gotten stuck in a tree nearby. We decided to rest and then see what we could do about getting her out. At about the same time the friendly owl we named Owl Wishes returned to us and Levi now seems to know where to find the base of the angle Maltremoric. We must be close now.

> Thanks for the recap, Daniel. This is very good.

> By the way, I do keep a campaign journal, but I do not intend to share it with you guys. I do definitely encourage this type of thing (it's why I ask you at the top what happened last time), so please feel free to send anything that is your character's interpretation or notes on what happened last time (not mandatory of course, but it's neat). Indeed, Livius's campaign journal for this last session is probably X-rated, so please do not send.

> The campaign journal I keep is only to issue corrections and clarifications, below. I don't want to take anything away from any in-character recaps, in case they are inaccurate on purpose, so these are corrections in case the rest of you did not keep clear notes and don't want to be led astray by Abraham's blood-red tinted glasses:

> Dorice is the elf child. She does get the gondolier down to 2 gold after much negotiation and watery eyes. The two other people who came onto the boat were just as fleeced as the rest of you. The town is Varak. Malthemac is the angel. The maiden and the demon were one in the same. Sorry if I was not clear on that. The priest's name was Phil. (As in Phillip, like of Macedon, so it does keep with the milieu, I promise.) Xanathos was one of the incense-burners. 

# The Succubus and the Hag

The gang starts escaping when Dorice comes out of the woods. It’s actually Sofronia and she commands Livius to attack Abe. The group bolts and Sofronia vanishes. The group fog clouds out of the problem and dashes. Malthamac flies overhead and the gang starts attacking him. He fights back and they kill him pretty easily.

The gang gets back to town and steals horses. They find Fanny, a strange little girl. They go back into town to replace Abe’s axe and Liv’s quarterstaff. Benfred tries to help them negotiate. They go up the mountain to find a shrine. Fanny is there and sings with Sora. She shows them butterflies on her arms. She eats a frog and throws up but then laughs it off.

They go to the shrine where the Nereid has taken over, but Cas cat-shifts and smooths things over with the Nereid and they’re good.

They go back down the mountain and run into Geth. Geth asks them to get a stone from Millie. They leave Taedor there for some reason. They go to Millie’s, with Abe distracting Benfred. Liv takes the stone from Millie, which she realizes and paralyzes Liv, taking the stone back. She asks them to bring her Fanny.

The gang goes back to Geth who is having sex with Taedor. Abe casts fog cloud and they roll initiative.

# The Fall of Baltsaros

The gang saves Taedor and fights off the green hag Geth and her ogre companion (who sound like the home improvement a-hooo sound). They go to the shrine and find Fanny and Geth again! They decide to retreat from Geth and montage to Argot.

The gang arrives in Argot and hands Taedor over. They make Taedor lie about the circumstances of his rescue (and have something over him in the green hag fucking). Abe is mad at Armand for not giving more info about his master’s murder because for some reason he thought Armand would know something about it.

Hespero reveals that he knows about the fuckery with Taedor’s rescue, leading Sora to inquire further about how Hespero knew. Hespero mind taps Sora and reveals that he feels like they are working toward the same purpose.

Abe goes to the constabulary and discovers that the murderer in this string of murders was a doppelgänger (from various sources).

They are ambushed by some meazels but avoid getting attacked by the Boggles as well. They make a scene and are able to get to the temple where they are ambushed by the guards. After brutally chopping off the faces of two of them and gassing the fourth, one of the guards, Axe Girl, tells them about the Bargainer and the body farming, saying that Baltsaros ordered them to ambush the party because Taedor wasn’t supposed to come back.

Fought Baltsaros, killed his thugs, brought him to Hespero. Leveled to 4. Got the info about the Mineosi body farming for ambassador stuff. Got money from Armand and Hespero.\
Sora stole Leandro’s love letters to Armand’s wife. She plans on getting Leandro elected and going to get Armand selected by lot.
