The gang saves [[Taedor]] and fights off the green hag Geth and her ogre companion (who sound like the home improvement a-hooo sound). They go to the shrine and find Fanny and Geth again! They decide to retreat from Geth and montage to Argot.

The gang arrives in Argot and hands Taedor over. They make Taedor lie about the circumstances of his rescue (and have something over him in the green hag fucking). Abe is mad at Armand for not giving more info about his master’s murder because for some reason he thought Armand would know something about it.

Hespero reveals that he knows about the fuckery with Taedor’s rescue, leading Sora to inquire further about how Hespero knew. Hespero mind taps Sora and reveals that he feels like they are working toward the same purpose.

Abe goes to the constabulary and discovers that the murderer in this string of murders was a doppelgänger (from various sources).

They are ambushed by some meazels but avoid getting attacked by the Boggles as well. They make a scene and are able to get to the temple where they are ambushed by the guards. After brutally chopping off the faces of two of them and gassing the fourth, one of the guards, Axe Girl, tells them about the Bargainer and the body farming, saying that Baltsaros ordered them to ambush the party because Taedor wasn’t supposed to come back.

Fought Baltsaros, Abraham subsequently tortured the hell out of him. 

Got the info about the Mineosi body farming for ambassador stuff. Got money from Armand and Hespero.

Sora stole Leandro’s love letters to Armand’s wife. She plans on getting Leandro elected and going to get Armand selected by lot.
