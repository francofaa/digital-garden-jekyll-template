title: Ferry
---
Ferry is a role in a [[Sea Units]] stack. It is the top block of the stack. 

Only [[Fleets]] can act as ferries units, with a [[Center]] of any unit except other fleets: 
- [[Cavalry]]
- [[Infantry]]
- [[Artillery]]
- [[Marines]]
- [[Aerial Units]]

# Attacking
When [[attacking]], ferry units attack in any direction. 

# Defending
When defending, ferry units protect their [[Center]]. Therefore any attack that comes at the [[Sea Units]] stack hits the ferry, per the center targeting rules, unless it is coming from [[Artillery]] or [[Aerial Units]], per their rules.

When a ferry unit is destroyed all units in the [[Center]] are also destroyed, except [[Aerial Units]] and [[Marines]].

# Movement
Ferries move their full [[movement]] as [[Fleets]].
