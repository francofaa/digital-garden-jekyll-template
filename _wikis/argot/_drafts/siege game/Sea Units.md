# Sea Units
Sea units include [[Fleets]] and [[Marines]]. These marine battalions may also be amphibious depending on special abilities; however, the rules below will relate only to those units that are actively in the sea spaces. 

# Sea Stacks
Blocks may be stacked from top to bottom: 
- [[Ferry]]: Top block
- [[Center]]: Up to 3 blocks

## Movement
Sea stacks move with the [[Movement]] of their ferry unit.  

Sea stacks may not rearrange. 

## Attacking
When [[Attacking]], [[Fleets]] may only attack other [[Fleets]] and [[Marines]] that are in the water. [[Marines]] may only attack when not on a [[Ferry]]
