Cavalry is one of the [[Ground Units]]. Cavalry represents mounted units. 

Cavalry units can
- only move 1 square (1 centimeter / 150 feet) in city territories
- attack only touching units 
- attack only from the [[rearguard]] or [[vanguard]] or when on its own

Cavalry can be aboard a [[Ferry]] for the purposes of being transported but cannot attack (since it is considered to be in the [[Sea Units]] Stack's [[Center]]).
