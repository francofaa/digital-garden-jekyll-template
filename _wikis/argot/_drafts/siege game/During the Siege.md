title: During the Siege
---
During planning final stages of the siege and the duration of the siege, you will be roleplaying as the Argot war command. Your characters will have to be a part of this command, and it will also include other prominent citizens., who will be roleplayed by me until the consensus has been reached. 

The consensus includes the expenditure of [[Resource Points]] to
- Train levies
- Build [[Fortifications]]
- Special anti-siege weaponry (be creative!)
- Spy

Use roleplaying (which may involve dealing in resource points) to resolve to varying interests of 
- the oppressed underclass of the Undercity
- Political factions
- Werriadi Republic
- Sickle Island nations
- Argolosi city-states

Once the consensus has been reached, you may then create a battle plan. This includes: 
- Positioning of troops
- Rally points
- Relief points 
- Standing orders
- Retreat plans
- Placement of resources

## Unrest Checks
At the end of a day, make a morale check for the city. After the city is fed, make a d20 + Resources versus DC 20. On a fail, the dungeon master holds 1 to create unrest in the city the next day. 

## Commanding and Communicating 
You will each command 3-5 units. You will roleplay as a commander of that unit (which can be your player character or a pre-existing or new commander). *You will not be able to communicate with one another freely.* This is to ensure everyone has a chance to play. You may ask and answer questions about the original battle plan on the meta level though.

To communicate to another commander / player, you must use the messenger action (free to do on your turn) to send a runner to the other commander. The runner moves 4 centimeters per round. Once that has happened, you may relay your message to the other player. 

You may also communicate freely to another commander 1 centimeter away.
