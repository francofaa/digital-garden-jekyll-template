title: Center
---
The Center is a [[Role]] in a stack representing the center of an army of [[Ground Units]] or representing the units aboard a [[Ferry]] of [[Sea Units]]. Refer to [[Units and Stacks]].

# Attacking
Only [[artillery]] units may attack from the center. Refer to [[Attacking]]

If the vanguard and rearguard both have enemies adjacent, any center units that can attack make that attack roll at disadvantage (but the power test is normal).

# Defending
Center may not be targeted except by [[Aerial Units]] or [[artillery]].

If a [[Ferry]] unit is destroyed, the center units are also destroyed unless they are sea creature battalions or [[Aerial Units]].

# Movement
Rules for movement differ depending on what kind of unit is in the center [[Role]].

## Ground Stack
Center units may not leave a [[Ground Units]] stack

## Sea Stack
Center units being ferried on a [[Sea Units]] stack may
- disembark from the stack using their movement onto a legal square. They may attack, unless they have already attacked. 
- embark onto a sea stack into its center.

# Aerial Units in Center
[[Aerial Units]] may also be part of a center. Refer to their rules for specifics on placement and [[Movement]], but basically
- Aerial units cannot attack from the center
- Aerial units may leave and enter the center at will
