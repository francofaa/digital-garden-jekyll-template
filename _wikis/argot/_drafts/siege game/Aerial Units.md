title: Aerial Units
---
Aerial units represent any combination of sky cavalry or airships. 

They must have a single blank block to indicate that the unit is in the sky. 

When [[Attacking]], Aerial units can target any unit on the board in range, including [[Center]] blocks of [[Sea Units]] and [[Ground Units]] stacks.

Aerial units can be placed inside of other stacks in the [[Center]], but they cannot use their [[Movement]] or [[Attacking]]; however, they may leave the [[Center]] with their movement as normal.
