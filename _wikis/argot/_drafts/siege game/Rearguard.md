title: Rearguard
---
A rearguard is a role in a stack representing the rearguard of an army of [[Ground Units]]. Refer to [[Units and Stacks]]. Rearguards are the bottom unit of a stack. 

# Attacking
The rearguard may only attack behind the stack. Whether a rearguard is attacking behind a stack will be adjudicated by the dungeon master with the advice of the players.

Refer to [[Attacking]]

# Defending
Only the vanguard of a stack may be targeted by an enemy unit. A [[Rearguard]] may only be attacked if the stack is attacked on an additional face[^1]. 

[^1]: It's a face because they are cubes. You can also say side I guess. 


# Movement
A [[Vanguard]] or Rearguard unit may leave a block in order to move its full movement speed. If a [[Center]] unit exists, it becomes the vanguard or rearguard.
