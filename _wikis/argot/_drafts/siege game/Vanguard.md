title: Vanguard
---
The vanguard is a [[Role]] in a stack representing the front of an army of [[Ground Units]] (see [[Units and Stacks]]). Vanguard units must be ground units. Vanguards are the top units of a stack.  

# Attacking
Vanguard units attack in any direction. Refer to [[Attacking]].

# Defending
**Only the vanguard of a stack may be targeted by an enemy unit.** A [[Rearguard]] may only be attacked if the stack is attacked on an additional face[^1]. 

[^1]: It's a face because they are cubes. You can also say side I guess. 

# Movement
A Vanguard or [[Rearguard]] unit may leave a block in order to move its full movement speed. If a [[Center]] unit exists, it becomes the vanguard or rearguard.
