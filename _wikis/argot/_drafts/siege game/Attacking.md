title: Attacking
---
A unit attacks by rolling a d20 + [[ATK]] against the opponent's [[AC]]. 

A success inflicts one [[casualty]] and the unit may then make a d20 + [[PWR]] against the opponent's [[TOUGHNESS]]. On a success, the attacker inflicts the full impact of their [[DMG]] on top of what they already inflicted with the successful attack. 

# Morale Checks
If a unit reaches half their [[size]] with this attack, they must immediately make a morale check, d20 + [[Morale]] versus DC 10. On a fail, the unit loses an additional casualty.

Once a unit attacks, it may no longer move and is considered exhausted. 

# Attacking as Part of a Stack
[[Vanguard]] may attack in any direction. 

Only [[Artillery]] in a [[Center]] may attack and they attack in any direction.

[[Rearguard]] may only attack behind the stack. 

[[Ferry]] units may only attack other [[Ferry]] units.
