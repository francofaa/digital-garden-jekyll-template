title: Infantry

Infantry is one of the [[Ground Units]]. It encompasses all manner of battalions that use melee attacks and short range missile attacks. 

Infantry can attack only when
- touching an enemy unit
- it is in the [[rearguard]] or [[vanguard]] of a stack or on its own

Infantry can be aboard a [[Ferry]] for the purposes of being transported but cannot attack (since it is considered to be in the [[Sea Units]] Stack's [[Center]]).
