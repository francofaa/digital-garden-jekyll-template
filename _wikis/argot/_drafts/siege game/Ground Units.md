# Ground Units
Ground units include artillery (archers, slingers, but also ranged siege engines), cavalry, and infantry. 

- [[Artillery]]
- [[Infantry]]
- [[Cavalry]]

# Ground Stacks
Blocks may be stacked from top to bottom: 
- [[Vanguard]]: The top block
- [[Center]]: Up to 2 center blocks
- [[Rearguard]]: The bottom block

A stack of 2 blocks has no center.

## Movement and Reconfiguration
Stacks move with the [[Movement]] of their *slowest unit*.

A [[Vanguard]] or [[Rearguard]] unit may peel off from a stack in order to move its full movement speed. If a [[Center]] unit exists, it becomes the vanguard or rearguard (depending on its physical position in the stack).

The units in a stack can **reconfigure** at the cost of all that stack's [[Movement]]. This means that a vanguard or rearguard cannot peel off as above, nor can [[Center]] [[Aerial Units]].

A unit may join a stack as its vanguard or rearguard only. Once a unit has joined a stack, that stack may no longer reconfigure but it may still move even though the new unit may have expended its movement to join the stack.

## Attacking
When [[Attacking]], Units in a stack attack individually. Vanguard and rearguard units attack as normal, but rearguards may only attack behind them. Only [[Artillery]] units may attack from the center of a ground unit. 

If the vanguard and rearguard both have enemies adjacent, any center units that can attack (like [[Artillery]]) make that attack roll at disadvantage (but the power test is normal).

## Defending
When a stack is attacked, vanguards must be targeted, unless:
- the attacking unit can target center units
- the target stack is being attacked from 2 sides, in which case the rearguard can also be targeted
