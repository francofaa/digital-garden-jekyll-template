What the hell are the boxes and marbles about? 

The marbles are two parts of a whole: the goat god is imprisoned in these two boxes. 

The yak folk found the farmer, a madman, who was trying to open the boxes and bring the goat god into the world. 

The yak folk killed the farmer but couldn't find the boxes (a goat ate one)

The boxes are interdimensional prisons but the energy still leeches through (so after two years the goat was transformed into the chimera)

The yak folk elder 

They find a book: 

The goat has two faces and its number is 56

After the heroes make it out of the wilderness, they can find Nervepeeler’s hut. She keeps a book of spells (containing Bheur hag spells and love letters to Natalya), but no sirablood recipes. But they do find 15 vials of sirablood. 

Charm: Kodama: Upon ridding the island of the hag, the Kodama will give you a charm 

> You find among the spells, letters written in three different hands. Upon further inspection, you can read that these are love letters, written in an archaic form, but still intelligible. They are from three different men, signed Temarian, Yoldo, and Sull. Each pines for the subject of the letter, Natalya. There is seemingly an order to these letters, each more desperate and maddened than the last, and they all seem unrequited. 

The village of the valley

> Beyond the storm, you see quite a different scene. Stony craggy mountains reach into the sky, shorter than the mountains of Hama, but they are snow-capped, perhaps due to the effects of Grandmother Nervepeeler’s magic. But between the mountains you see rolling hills of green mottled with yellow flowers. 

As the heroes go on: 

> You come upon a village in the valley. On two sides of a creek two structures dominate this village: a tall pillar and a windmill. A humble wooden bridge connects the two sides. 

The villagers live enslaved in an idyllic seeming community in the valley. The magical cold does not reach them here, and the Goatfolk rule these people with an iron fist.



Livius’s goat staff should glow when they enter this village. But you see no goats.
A possessed human greets you first, happy to meet you. 

> “Good day! I am Wistopher, pleased to meet you! Welcome to Iskos Valley. We are pleased to see travelers. We get so few visitors.”

The pillar

There is a tall smooth stone pillar, some 30 feet high. The stone pillar has the face of a goat carved on it, at eye height. Three rings of stone surround it, like wells. Each of them is six feet tall. One is damp from water and covered in moss and its bottom is all stone. One is black on the inside from ashes. The other is piled with dirt to the rim of the well. 

Each sacrificial victim must toil to become sacrificed: Lugging buckets of water to fill the well, digging their own well, making fire, and climbing the pillar.
