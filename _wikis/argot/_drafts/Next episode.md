the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 


Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys




victim of another injustice, paloma opens her eyes to the cruelties of her liege lord. 





The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

they thrashed that old kraken
with the whip of their tails

Here come the grinner
the wickedest fey

Brought with him an oni 
and wizard to play



didn't reckon three wizards 
are better than one

here come the kraken with thunder and gale

and then come along a trio of whales

the kraken bore down with his terrible

the thunder of giants

the sun on high, the clouds below

they'll break on the waters
bones crushed on the sea

the skyswimmer's treasure


silence his words 
that be sharp as his teeth



may your arrow strike true
may his heart be your sheath 

sail through the clouds
where the skyswimmer flies 

beware of the tiger 
beware of his lies 

from the tiger's cage 
to the deathless one's 


return to our shores
to save our city once more 

bested the kraken, freed from its teeth 
the grinner the wickedest fey

forsaken us 

adrift on the seas




the kraken raised up a terrible storm

the heroes never lost heart 

our bard stranded out to sea 

The necromancer burned its hide


Cut his lives down to three
May the cat never 

whiskers

driven into the hold

brave cat did slay 
the grinner that wickedest fey




away away to these haunted shores
where our ancestors toiled and bled
