After the heroes make it out of the wilderness, they can find Nervepeeler’s hut. She keeps a book of spells (containing Bheur hag spells and love letters to Natalya), but no sirablood recipes. But they do find 15 vials of sirablood. 

Charm: Kodama: Upon ridding the island of the hag, the Kodama will give you a charm 

> You find among the spells, letters written in three different hands. Upon further inspection, you can read that these are love letters, written in an archaic form, but still intelligible. They are from three different men, signed Temarian, Yoldo, and Sull. Each pines for the subject of the letter, Natalya. There is seemingly an order to these letters, each more desperate and maddened than the last, and they all seem unrequited. 

The village of the valley

> Beyond the storm, you see quite a different scene. Stony craggy mountains reach into the sky, shorter than the mountains of Hama, but they are snow-capped, perhaps due to the effects of Grandmother Nervepeeler’s magic. But between the mountains you see rolling hills of green mottled with yellow flowers. 

As the heroes go on: 

> You come upon a village in the valley. On two sides of a creek two structures dominate this village: a tall pillar and a windmill. A humble wooden bridge connects the two sides. 

The villagers live enslaved in an idyllic seeming community in the valley. The magical cold does not reach them here, and the Goatfolk rule these people with an iron fist.

Livius’s goat staff should glow when they enter this village. But you see no goats.
A possessed human greets you first, happy to meet you. 

> “Good day! I am Wistopher, pleased to meet you! Welcome to Iskos Valley. We are pleased to see travelers. We get so few visitors.”

The pillar

There is a tall smooth stone pillar, some 30 feet high. The stone pillar has the face of a goat carved on it, at eye height. Three rings of stone surround it, like wells. Each of them is six feet tall. One is damp from water and covered in moss and its bottom is all stone. One is black on the inside from ashes. The other is piled with dirt to the rim of the well. 

Each sacrificial victim must toil to become sacrificed: Lugging buckets of water to fill the well, digging their own well, making fire, and climbing the pillar. 

The villagers

Some of the villagers tell you about Aramestes, who lives in the castle high in the mountains. 

> “We are his subjects, but he has not come down to see us in hundreds of years. The mountain paths are treacherous now and none come down or go up, or out into the wilderness, out to the shores. Work is our only joy.”

He contains a Goatfolk inside of him, Impi, a priest

When they say that they want to go to the castle, the villager says:

> “You must be weary from your travels though, friend. Stay and rest a while.”

Main hut

The heroes can go and see the elder, Kipto, a priest. 

Impi, as the man, requests that they leave their weapons at the door when entering the hut.

> Rather than a humanoid sitting at a desk, you instead see a large goat-headed humanoid, burly, and adorned with ribbons and wearing a tunic and skirt. 
> 
> “Good day, travelers. I am Kipto, the village elder.”

When asked about Aramestes:

> “That old beast. He is probably dead. It’s only been six hundred years!” Kipto scoffs.

Mountain Pass

Up the mountain pass, the heroes see a niche where a small shrine is placed. 

> The face of whoever was honored here has been lost to time, but the stone woman wears alchemist’s robes and holds potions and a book. Three tiny bowls of thick black liquid sit in a place of offering before this statuette. It is sirablood. 

Up the winding paths, the heroes will have to make a perception check DC 18 to see the abominable yeti creeping up on them. 

It is afraid of fire.
