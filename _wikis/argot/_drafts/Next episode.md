BAKASURA ENCOUNTER: 
- mass suggestion: take everything off, gives them rusty swords 
- begin combat: destructive wave, chromatic orb may replace one weapon attack 
- zakya rakshasas will use superiority die every turn 

Gerrik, leader of the bugbears, infected with rage virus



turns out it has started because the bugbears began drinking a sirablood contaminated water source

The rakshasas had started mining and the sirablood leaked in there

give them all what's happening on each of the islands in the next session:

There is a monstrous creature on Dorost that has awakened and it is fiendish

There is a fiendish creature in Nistora

There are fiends and undead on Charatos. There is a disease run rampant on Charatos

Move them along from the arguments, don't let them rehash it 

If Rho decides to leave, have Nausicaa spot Abe and Baltsaros flying toward them, Baltsaros says "You guys kept flying back and forth, we kept losing you, is everything OK?"

drop of pitch containing a devil that is keeping nistora afloat, set there by hespero, slaves also live on the island; devil inside that hates hespero and offers to help

bugbears are infected with a rage virus, can be cured, turns them into undead but they can be brought back and healed

the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 

Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys

Malory becomes a boss monster, defeats the unspeakable one, not a great way unless he becomes sane 

before giving charon a peach, he would have spent a long time tripping balls in his past lives, absorbing them all

The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

forgot to mention: serena lets you off, pins it all on paloma

show us the ugliness in the world

nistora cloud giant culture

- riffrick is a slaver and paloma worked with him
- duchess is not a slaver, read her mind
- duchess never actually attacked them 


Serena is going to be using telekinesis

they thrashed that old kraken

Here come the grinner
the wickedest fey

Brought with him an oni 
and wizard to play



didn't reckon three wizards 
are better than one

here come the kraken with thunder and gale

and then come along a trio of whales

the kraken bore down with his terrible 









the sun on high, the clouds below

the sun on high, the clouds below

they thrashed that old kraken

the thunder of giants 
be no match for we

the sun on high, the clouds below

they'll break on the waters
bones crushed on the sea

the skyswimmer's treasure


silence his words 
that be sharp as his teeth



may your arrow strike true
may his heart be your sheath 

sail through the clouds
where the skyswimmer flies 

beware of the tiger 
beware of his lies 

from the tiger's cage 
to the deathless one's 


return to our shores
to save our city once more 

bested the kraken, freed from its teeth 
the grinner the wickedest fey

the devil has 

forsaken us 

adrift on the seas




the kraken raised up a terrible storm

the heroes never lost heart 

our bard stranded out to sea 

The necromancer burned its hide


Cut his lives down to three
May the cat never 

whiskers

driven into the hold

brave cat did slay 
the grinner that wickedest fey




away away to these haunted shores
where our ancestors toiled and bled
