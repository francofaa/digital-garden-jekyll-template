You must come up with a way that you all know each other: 
- strings
- debts
- bonds
- grudges

What is your family like? 

Come up with a religion together. Tell me about your god or gods. 

Come up with your language together.

What is your background?


the invaders call you foreign and strange

where you live: 
- the outskirts of the village, you are faithful to your god
- in the village, you still practice your faith secretly while worshipping the invader's god
- in the village, you are descended from converts but the invaders still regard you with suspicion 

faceless god

Making classes

play style: things the character knows that they are good at; they are good at some things, worse at other things; some things are only available to certain classes

understand the flavor of it 

tremere: clan weakness lends itself to

synergy and harmonization of classes 

interesting roles
play style 
mechanics 
niche protection 
weaknesses


City of Heroes

Secret World (classes based on equipment -- healing by bleeding yourself, tanking with gear, DPS with gear)

Maybe there should be skill trees? 

decoys, debuffers (causing enemies to skip turns)

\- Fast multi-hit melee fighter \- Balanced melee fighter \- Slow single-hit melee fighter \- Multiple projectile ranged fighter \- Rapid fire ranged fighter \- High accuracy ranged fighter \- Debuff offensive magic \- Controller offensive magic \- Damage offensive magic \- Healing defensive magic \- Negation defensive magic \- Buffing defensive magic

# Adam Millard - The Architect of Games: "Why Do So Many Games Have Tanks, Healers and DPS?"

control the momentum of the fight 

Trinity: Tanks, Healers, DPS

define each of the three roles by dominant form of interaction: 

self <> ally <> enemy

each class should have a way to interact in these different manners: 

- self > ally
- ally > enemy
- self > enemy

! crowd control ! (aspect of tanking)

tanking: keep enemies occupied
dmg reduction, stuns

support: buff, heal

damage dealers: dmg dmg dmg 

split special and physical attack 

everyone gets the same skills so they rotate depending on the situation 

systemic mechanics or environmental: adds a new layer 

interactions with environment: rain washes away poison, fire, increases lightning damage

summoning pets 

economic elements

- ally
- enemy
- environment
- economy

planning ambushes


# Burning Wheel

wheel = game 

hub: PCs

spokes: abilities, beliefs, instincts, traits (mechanics)

rim = steel, relationships, duel of wits, range, cover, shields, 

artha points = spin: the middle ground between the obsession with self enlightenment and transcendence 

will
power 
agility
perception
forte
speed 

obstacle difficulty rating 

each stat is leveled up individually 

fate - persona - deed 

fate = more common, roleplay well, funny moments 

persona = great rp moment, stated goal accomplishment, voted mvp

deed = rarest: major feat accomplished, requires personal sacrifice 

you can only level up a skill when you apply the skill point when doing the skill 

depth and detail required -- 12 step process

1. character concept, just a few words, fit with other pcs and settings
2. life paths: segments of your life (3-7) that have occurred. Path specific traits and skills
3. age
4. buy your stats: mental and physical points that can be used to buy stats 
5. list your skills (which gets complicated), related to specific objects 
6. traits: trait points
7. attributes: health, mortal wound (the point at which you receive a mortal wound), reflexes, health, faith / grief / greed / hatred 
8. resource points (relationships, spells, affiliations, reputations): every character must have a relationship with an npc. 
9. resources and circles: resources is your stuff; circles is sphere of influence 
10. physical tolerance: how badly are you hurt when injured: mortal, traumatic severe, midi, light, superficial. Immediately debilitated, shadow of your former self
11. beliefs and instinct. Action + Condition (belief). I will kill my chief if he is not successful in the next raid. Avenge my wife's death, etc (sticking to them or violating them give you rewards). Instincts: IF-THEN: I never break bread with dwarves; if my friends are threatened, I put myself between them (give conditions)
12. name your character. Humans: 10 settings, faith-based. Sorcerer (67 spell access). Elves: grief: reaching 10 kills them off basically. Magic: 33 spell songs (healing, friendships). Dwarves: greed, max 10; no magic but dwarven arts. Orcs: hatred. Void embrace: blood and night rituals. 


(blood art: lets them become monstrous)

spell songs 

lingering injuries (fighting and injury recovery)
