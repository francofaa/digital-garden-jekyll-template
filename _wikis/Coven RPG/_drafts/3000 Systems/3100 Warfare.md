3-harm: widespread injuries, many serious, several fatalities. 
4-harm: widespread serious injuries, many fatalities.

### Morale
When your army suffers harm, roll +common. On a 10+, . 7-9, your army
- retreats in an orderly fashion, suffering few casualties

**NOTE ON NPC ATTACKS**
The first attack on the heroes is always harmless. Present the monster as a threat attacking them but don't inflict harm. Just place the monster there and ask the heroes what they want to do.
