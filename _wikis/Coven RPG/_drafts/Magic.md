# Magic
## Spellcasting

When you want to cast a spell, mark off 1 or more spell charges and roll +faith. On a 10+, you successfully cast the spell. On a 7-9, the spell is successful, but there is a glitch, chosen by the herald.

On a failure, the spell is cast but the glitch is catastrophic.

Some glitches are spell-specific but the following are generic glitches that may occur:
- The effect is weakened
- The effectâ€™s duration is short
- You take 1 harm magic
- The spell draws unwelcome attention
- It has a problematic side effect

**Advanced:** On a 12+, pick 1:
- Gain back 1 charge
- Spell deals an additional +1 harm, where applicable
- Spell has a bigger effect (duration, number of targets, or larger range)

## Brewing and Quaffing

**Brewing**

When you take time, gather ingredients, and brew a potion or fixative, roll +wits. 10+, there is no incident. 7-9, pick 1. On a miss, pick 2:

- The substance is ruined and unusable
- Your equipment is ruined and must be replaced
- Things explode and you and everyone around you suffer 3 damage, area, close, loud

**Quaffing a potion**

When you quaff a potion, roll +grit. On a hit the effect is successful, but on a 7-9, the herald chooses a glitch: 

- The effect is weakened
- The effect is too extreme
- The effect's duration is short
- The effect's duration is too long
- The drinker takes 1 damage, ignore armor
- The drinker has a problematic side effect 

On a miss, prepare for the worst
