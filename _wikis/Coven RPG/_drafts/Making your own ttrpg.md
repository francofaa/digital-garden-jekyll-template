Making your own ttrpg

Why are you making the system? What is the goal? Keep the goal because it will sustain you as you receive feedback 

Pick your genre 

Ideas for combat: 

Action cards to create simultaneous play

Resolution mechanism: no dice, interpretive, dice based, comparison, do you have the skill then yes; agreement and consensus. Allocation of points

2d6 system: failure, mixed or full success

What mechanics do we use to determine yes or no?

Ryuutama: Mixture of dice

Testing your system: Test it against a standard scenario: How does your character climb a cliff?

Figure out melee, magic, ranged 

Test with real people, test at least twice before tweaking

Flesh out the rules: equipment, etc

maybe the war game should be a different stat and

# Notes 

- Make something that can be played right away. Play it over and over until it feels right 
- Use real things to give momentum to the fictional things (use the stats, the rolls, the timing, the failures, the damage, the armor to drive the fiction)
- play collapses toward the center, down to the “conversation” of the fiction. graceful degradation in case the top layers dont work out
	- topmost layer is the custom moves, playbooks
	- playbooks, character moves, character crap, threats
	- stats dice core moves harm improvement mc moves
	- conversation mc agenda and principle 

## AW’s systems
- timeframes
- structures (fictional causes have real effects, real causes have fictional effects)
- handoffs
- consequences (scopes and scales)
- permissions and expectations 

Build out systems: 

- Harm and healing,
- moves,
- threats
- gear and crap 
- improvement
- playbooks
- moves 

These systems lead to each other. One move leads to another move, but this other move leads to harm and healing, but this third movel eads to improvement. 

## Starting

- Think of the game’s genre , mood , feeling 
- think of the game’s character

```ad-note
### skeleton king

You awoke suddenly and clawed your way out from your crypt, life suddenly surging through your brittle bones from the final incantation placed upon you at the moment of your death. You now find yourself in a world you do not understand, surrounded by lowborn fools and barbaric customs. Your monuments lie in ruins, your deeds forgotten, your servants gone to dust. But your time is not over. Among the endless dead there must yet lie those who remember your glory, ready to rise at your summons and bring the world once more under your heel.

**STARTING LIFE: 4**

**STARTING MANA: 6**

**SKILLS:** Roll six times on the following table and add the results to your character sheet. If you roll the same skill more than once, add the bonuses. If a roll would raise a skill above +3, reroll.

1.  Outdated Etiquette +1
2.  Ancient History +1
3.  Dead Languages +1
4.  Obscure Philosophy +1
5.  Willpower +1
6.  Ceremonial weapon of your choice +1

**EQUIPMENT**

-   Crown
-   Ceremonial weapon of your choice
-   As many gold coins as you can carry (200 coins fill an item slot).

**ABILITIES**

-   You can speak the language of the undead and the secret language of all royalty.
-   You can spend 1 mana and take 10 minutes to reanimate a skeleton. Upon reanimation, roll on the reaction table to find its disposition. Hostile skeletons were enemies of your empire in life, while helpful skeletons are utterly loyal to you. Those in the middle may have to be incentivized.
-   You are undead and are immune to hunger, thirst, exhaustion, poison, disease, etc.
