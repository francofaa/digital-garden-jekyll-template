Making your own ttrpg

Why are you making the system? What is the goal? Keep the goal because it will sustain you as you receive feedback 

Pick your genre 

Ideas for combat: 

Action cards to create simultaneous play

Resolution mechanism: no dice, interpretive, dice based, comparison, do you have the skill then yes; agreement and consensus. Allocation of points

2d6 system: failure, mixed or full success

What mechanics do we use to determine yes or no?

Ryuutama: Mixture of dice

Testing your system: Test it against a standard scenario: How does your character climb a cliff?

Figure out melee, magic, ranged 

Test with real people, test at least twice before tweaking

Flesh out the rules: equipment, etc

maybe the war game should be a different stat and
