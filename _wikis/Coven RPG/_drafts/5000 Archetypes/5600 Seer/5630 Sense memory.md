Whenever you handle or examine something interesting, roll +eerie. On a hit, you can ask the Herald questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7–9, ask 1:
- who handled this last before me?
- who made this?
- what strong emotions have been most recently nearby this?
- what words have been said most recently nearby this?
- what has been done most recently with this, or to this?
- what’s wrong with this and how might I fix it?

Treat a miss as if it were a spell glitching.
