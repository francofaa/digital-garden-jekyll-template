# Faction Building 
- Who wants what from whom
- What happens if they don't get it / do get it 
- Why is it happening now

*Power, wealth, violence are not goals.* They are means to an end.

Example: Centimanus City of a Hundred Hands: 

- who built this dungeon?
   - Centimane elves were afraid that the gods were creating more creatures and created a dungeon. Where did they get their great power? 
      - They worship Cottus, a many handed god cast down by the major gods who decided to go along with the Centimane elves
      - Cottus also has a cult: Hand of Cottus
         - why would they serve it?
   - Monsters that exist 
      - unconsecrated dead that create spiders with their bodies
         - want to be buried with honor
      - undead knights that lead undead ghosts. Wraith-Keepers
         - want to have their contracts annulled 

# Dungeon Building

 http://dungeon.totalpartykill.ca/

Use the dngngen generator for making dungeons because it makes weird and unique combos 

Apply 2-4 tags to the map. 

jot down quick high level ideas: 
- concept
- contents

roll 9d6

1. open path, entrance, clearing
2. alternative path (water or ascent)
3. key destination (treasure)
4. passive threat, hazards, terrain
5. danger, enemy convergences 
6. blocked or locked, can't travel by normal means

Include a Black Door to incentivize returning to the dungeon for a bigger challenge. 

Come up with traps from OSR sources. 

Give Characters clear outs when facing a much more powerful opponent. 

## Quick Build Tips

1. Something old: What was this place used for?
2. Something new: What is happening now that the heroes must solve?
3. Something borrowed: Monsters, characters, treasures, etc that already exist that you know about 
4. Something blue: Something that makes you sad/emotion, something that makes you feel something

Start from the inside out (from the final boss and treasure room to the entrances). Plan set pieces, not puzzles

Dungeon crawling should promote **exploration**. 

## Step By Step
1. setting concept
2. region the heroes start in 
3. 3 levels of a megadungeon 
   1. each level should have a theme 
   2. 7-12 rooms per dungeon level (or 20 to 40!)
      3. monsters, npcs, strangeness, etc
   3. jaquay the dungeon
   4. working way around obstacles 
   5. wandering monster table 
4. layout and inhabitants of the town outside the dungeon
   1. bare bones of a town
   2. rumors
   3. shops
   4. locations that are useful to characters specifically
5. spread out from there


- Add a clock on quest deadlines
- Multiple entrances
- Purpose
- Levels sign-posted with difficulty 
- Loops
- Verticality 
- Places to get the drop on people 
- Secret areas
- Weirdly shaped rooms
- Debris, cover
- Verb-able environment (such as a collapsing ceiling trap during a battle)
- Recognizable features
- Architectural motifs to separate zones
- Tactical features: Bridges, chokepoints, uphill areas, doors
- Spying opportunities: Portcullises, echoey rooms, one-way mirrors, speaking tubes
- Wandering monsters: Threats that appear if heroes linger for too long
- Evidence of monsters, such as 
   - tracks
   - bloody tracks
   - carcass of recent kill
   - remains of campsite 
   - droppings
   - graffiti 
- A friendly or neutral NPC to break up the terror and claustrophobia of a dungeon 
   - worry
   - goal
   - appearance quirk
- Descriptions of upcoming rooms in a dungeon (so that the direction to go is meaningful)
   - rely on five senses (you hear something down this hall, you smell something down that hall, etc)
- Events and activities (like mining operations or a feast)
- Countdowns and escalations: Crumbling, summoning a demon, creatures transforming into more powerful versions of themselves, flooding, etc)
- Side quests (such as hidden things within the dungeon)
- Traps that the heroes can trigger on the enemies 



## Puzzles
- Four chains that lift up a door that needs the door to be lifted. 
- make faces out of artifacts 
- pointless lever: lever in a room. Door slams shut behind them. Magical numbers start counting down. Lever lets them get more time
- bewitching room: mannequins, purple fog; saving throws against wis / cha; failures see animated armor start moving 
- door of shame: talking door requires secret shames to be spoken into the door to be opened
- a sound argument: two ghosts arguing.

**Refer to Riven**

puzzles: Gather enough context to solve the puzzle.

Reorg the information

distribute the information about the puzzle throughout the world or dungeon 


## Traps
When a trap is triggered, say click and ask what the characters do and if they do not respond right away, they roll with dis or with adv

Make the trap obvious 

Traps that have already been sprung (and may still be active)

Trap decoys

Traps as a treasure 

Traps that are triggered by a character that hurt a different character

Traps that trigger an encounter

Traps that don't act as damage penalties

## Examples
- knee-deep water held back by a sealed door (slides open and locks itself inside the wall.) Players must block off the water within three rounds, water floods into next few chambers, raising water level enough to allow the in ground pools of water to release swarm of quippers into hallways 
- treasure bugs: corpse with torn coin purse with coins gems jewelry (but it's a crazy amount of money). After several minutes, the bugs which have false appearance turn into swarms of bugs. (Corpse has bug bites and stuff)
- smooth-faced statue when you look at it turns you to stone and reshapes your face to be blank. Medusa would be in this dungeon: so they have a salve of stone to flesh. The person still had smooth-face and couldn't breath so they had to have their mouth cut open 
- room with a chest and a skeleton: its a skeleton not a mimic chest lol , got eem


## Purposeful Traps
Traps need purpose: 
- Who built the trap? 
- Why would they set it up in the first place? 
- Why take the time?

Reasons:
- Keep people out
- Keep people in
- capture 
- kill 
- scare 
- deter
- hidden
- obvious

What do you want the trap to accomplish

Logical purpose, purposeful force trying to stop them 

### Keep people out
deterrent obvious traps: flame traps

chutes or teleports: they throw them out of the dungeon 

blocking the path forward: collapsing pillars, closing stone walls: What side do they want to be stuck on?

Lethal traps: statues with disintegration rays: No punches pulled

### Keep people in 
1 way passages and you can't move back

Tend to overlap with capture traps (get them stuck in one spot)

Evil creature may be luring a creature into their lair, lich might be trying to move them into an area to drain them 

dungeon full a treasure: adds to treasure by trapping the characters and their gear

sloped tunnel with angled blades going back up 

wall trap to deposit characters into one location 

bridge collapsing 

restraint traps (snares, vines, bare traps, magic fields, monsters with paralysis)

### Traps that judge people 
testing the people coming in 

switches for languages, spikes for dextrous, filtering out individuals who don't fit the requirements

arcane eye that watches people

oozes that eat gear but not people 

### Traps that annoy
weapon-rubberizers

gravity reversals 

annoyance traps should only be trickster dungeons

### Traps that weaken

expenditure of materials or spells or hp: specifically made to make the characters weakened: preventing a fair fight!



# Danger Spikes
Wilderness will contain spikes in danger even if the region is a certain challenge rating. 

Dungeons will also contain spikes in danger, though they should be clearly telegraphed by a very difficult to traverse Black Door. 

# Situations, not Plots
Create a dungeon and hooks will come off of these dungeons.

Intelligence (skulking, overhearing, researching) or Willpower (influencing, intimidation, persuasion) checks to retrieve rumor hooks.

Example: A bandit king has installed himself at a temple complex, supplied with undead minions from a local necromancer. 

Hooks: 
- bandits are raiding the countryside
- powerful artifact was stolen 
- old legends about the temple and what it contains 
- the undead are seen near the temple

Rumors can be gathered from locals or traveling merchants. 

Situations can also be renewed. If the bandit king is killed, for example, another faction can infest the dungeon, increasing replayability of the scenario. 

--- 

> In fact, Iâ€™d argue that the best status quo design is usually more like a coiled spring: The lightest interaction from the PCs will cause an _explosion_ of activity.

Prep situations, not plots. Status quo shouldn't mean boring: it should mean that whatever is happening there always is happening there and nothing changes until the players interact--and an interaction from the player will likely mean something pops the fuck off even from the slightest interaction

*Returning to the status quo*: Once the heroes take care of something, something new can occupy that dungeon or the enemies can call in reinforcements

---
Use the doomsday clock for each situation to advance the situations as the players advance. 

## Other Hooks
- Open ended bounty boards
- Factions want certain monster parts or resources
- Haunted woods: Trees who want to be made into masks and become actors:
   - Haunted mask: Wearing the mask causes a ghost to possess you if you fail a DC 15 MD save
- Rare orchids being destroyed to inflate their prices
- Poisoned king
- Where do the black ships go?
- Kidnapper monsters
- Bodies washing up on the coast, from far away lands
- Ash rain

# Fronts, Threats, Settlements
> use dungeon world for 
> - grim portents / fronts
> - settlements (wants and relationships, other stuff)

1. Write the theme sentence: 
   -  Save Argot from the Deathless One
2. Six Truths of the Game
3. Three Pillars of Play
   1. exploration
   2. combat
   3. social interactions
4. Fronts of the Game 
   
These are factions or threats that have **goals**, **3 portents**, **1 impending doom**

Or 
-   Who is the major NPC?
-   What is their goal?
-   Who is their lieutenant?
-   What group enforces their will? (Henchmen)

# Home Base
The starting town should be boring, without adventures within. The heroes will also need a home base that can hold their massive wealth. They can use gold to buy strongholds. These can in the future themselves become dungeons. 


# Loot
Loot should not just be treasures but also 
- boons
- lore and knowledge
- cool but useless items 
- hints at weaknesses for bosses 
- NPC contacts, allies, and friends
- Pets and followers 
- new skills and languages
- trinkets that are junk but sellable, like skulls, claws, teeth, monster parts
- costumes
- jewelry 
- sextants
- boons
- blessings
- charms
- properties: deeds to bakeries, tea houses, bathhouses
- broken items that can be repaired
- parts of a cool weapon 
- vehicles: cart, horses, wagons, warhorse, ship
- lands and titles, along with serfs (maybe over 10th level)
- mundane weapons and armor that looks really cool
- faction favor or disfavor
- things to inform backstory 
- special privileges
- public recognition: feast, public banquet, public announcement, monument, parade, have a place named after you
- trainings
- services: powerful magics
- decorations: medals, etc
- appointments to positions 

# Adventure Hooks

# West Marches
Each character can have their own business or life or whatever, they can chat and stuff as well 

> Hand-in-hand with the need for regenerative content, however, is the ability to quickly and easily expand the content of the campaign for long-term players. (In a megadungeon this is as easy as adding more dungeon levels. In a hexcrawl, you simply continue drawing hexes on the edges of your map.)

Your first hex crawl for a west march campaign could just be a days march hex crawl

Sessions should be sponsored by the players : I want to explore this dungeon,  I want to stop these bandits, I want to retrieve this corpse, etc 

Waiting list: 

> Then I imposed table caps.
> 
> The system is pretty simple: I cap the number of players at a certain number. These slots are filled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the cap is hit, thatâ€™s it for that session.
> 
> To prevent highly active players from monopolizing the slots at every session, I also instituted the concept of the Waiting List: If you signed up for a session, but couldnâ€™t play because of the session cap, then you were given preferential placement for the next session.
> 
> The Waiting List also helps cope with the problem of last minute cancellations (because you can call up the next person on the waiting list).
> 
> The size of your table cap is almost entirely up to you (and possibly the comfortable limits of your playing space). For example, I know that I can run 5 players comfortably, 6 players are usually manageable, and with 7+ players the quality of the session will usually begin to decline. So I set my table cap at 5 and occasionally have a sixth player join (usually the significant other of the fifth player).


Players must have character stables if their characters are still in a dungeon when another adventure starts, or they can escape the dungeon. 





# lost dungeon crawling rules of dnd 
*The dungeon hates you*

The dungeon has turns: 10 minute chunks

Pressure plate that goes off after it is triggered 3 times 

Sequence of play per turn: 
1. wandering monsters
2. actions: players decide what actions to take (moving, searching, listening, entering room)
3. description: ref describes what happens, if monsters are encountered follow encounter procedures 
4. end of turn: ref updates time records, light sources / spell duration / party's need torest 

Each **Turn** is 10 minutes long: 
- resource expended
- how long light burns 
- amount of distance can travel 

resource management is important 

stuck doors and locked doors

once every two turns, you roll for wandering monster, 1/6 chance of wandering monster actually appears; wandering monsters are encounter 2d6 x 10 feet away moving in the direction of the party: so, right around the corner, or way down the way long enough to see 

monster reaction roles

pursuit: line of sight must be maintained for the monster to continue to chase you; you could drop food or treasure (50% chance of this working) or throwing down obstacles like burning oil or caltrops

- Augury bones: Roll WIL x d6. Ask a question for every 6. Your gods provide an answer of "Weal," "Woe," or "Weal and Woe". You cannot use this again until the next dawn. 



CAST THE BONES: Your deity tells you how many spells you can safely cast that day. Your deity is capricious and unknowable. Roll Ld6. This is the number of spell points you have. You can expend these spell points to 

Every spell you cast beyond that number requires a FATE CHECK. Roll 2d6. On a 10+, the spell succeeds. On a 9-7, the spell succeeds with a catastrophic backfiring. On a 6 and below, the spell fails and backfires.

https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/generators/




each dungeon should have fewer than 8 rooms, 

adventures should be fully xp'd in one session

combat limited

dangerous locations should include refs to other locations

the keep on the borderlands (gygax)

place smaller pockets of monsters that all vie for control of sections: all of these enemies are trying to have squabbles and their own dungeons to be looted

give players xp incentives  and healing potions to 
- mapping
- treasure accntg
- quest logging 

all this journaling will let other absent players knows whats out there

monsters of the week and over arcing big bads: why not?
