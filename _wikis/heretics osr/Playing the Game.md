# Exploration
## Dungeon
Exploring a dungeon is done in turns. Each turn represents 10 minutes of exploration. 

Sequence of play per turn: 
1. **Wandering monsters**, if present, move through the dungeon.
2. **Actions**: The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 
3. **Description**: The referee describes what happens. If monsters are encountered, refer to the combat section. 
4. **End of turn**: Referee updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest. 

### 1 Wandering Monsters
Roll 1d6 every 2 turns in a dungeon. On a 6, the wandering monster appears 2d6 x 10 feet moving toward the party. 

### 2 Actions
The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 

Characters may search for 
- room traps (within a 10 x 10 area)
- secret doors (within a 10 x 10 area)
- treasure traps (on a specific object or location)

**Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight** and even modern infantry doesn't conduct operations at night. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.

There is a 1/6 chance of finding these things. The roll is made in secret by the referee. 

There is a 2 in 6 chance that a trap is triggered when a character makes an action that could trigger the trap. 

Characters move at a rate of 3 times their base speed. So a character that moves 40 feet in a combat turn moves 120 feet in a dungeon turn, which represents slow careful movement.

Movement through already explored areas may be allowed at a faster rate. 

### 3 Description
Referee describes what happens. 

### 4 End of Turn
- **Time-keeping device:** Measure the amount of time they are in the dungeon. Use 1d6 where every activity is 10 minutes and every die is one hour. From 6 to 1, their **torches burns out**. Other taxing conditions can take effect (cold, heat, magical effects, etc)
- After 1 hour (6 dungeon turns), the characters **must rest for 1 turn** or will suffer disadvantage on attack rolls. 

Resting for 1 hour in the dungeon heals 1d8 + str bonus. Resting for 8 hours is not possible in a dungeon.

### Rolling to Return
Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in civilization or back at a camp, as may be during a Western Marches campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

The referee determines whether this is a dangerous or arduous journey.

DC = 10 + hour of travel, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 load of equipment per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 flesh, they die or are left unconscious, suffering all of the effects of being reduced to 0. The referee picks what load is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons and armor. 

## Wilderness

### Watches
Days are split up into 6 watches (about 3 in the day and 3 in the night), each 4 hours long. 

A navigator should be declared. 

### Traveling
Characters move 6 miles per watch (4 hours).

Movement is halved through difficult terrain, in darkness, and in bad weather. Movement is doubled when riding a mount or going solely by road. 

#### Forced March
Traveling longer than 3 watches (12 hours) requires a +str save of DC 15 per additional watch or suffer 1 point of direct damage (to flesh). 

#### Navigation
Navigator determines direction and navigates. The referee rolls that character's +int as necessary (determined by table below). If the characters have an accurate map, this is also not necessary:

| Navigation                                                     | DC       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Road, open sea with land in sight                              | No check |
| Grassland, coast, plains, farmland                             | 5        |
| Arctic, desert, hills, open sea with clear skies               | 10       |
| Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, open sea with overcast skies | 15       |
| Any region with white-out precipitation                        | +3       |
:Navigation

##### Failed Navigation
On a failed navigation check, the referee should roll 1d10 in secret. 

| d10  | Direction               |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4  | veered into left hex    |
| 5-6  | arrived in intended hex |
| 7-10 | veered into right hex   |
:Failed Navigation (Lost)

### Activities
Characters can spend a full watch in a 30 square mile area (6 mile hex) in order to forage or explore. 

#### Exploring 
Players spending time exploring find points of interest that wouldn't be identified while traveling right through a hex. 

#### Foraging for food and hunting 
Characters may forage and hunt for food. This requires a +int check depending on the environment. 

| Foraging                                    | DC  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Abundant food and water sources             | 10  |
| Limited food and water sources              | 15  |
| Very little, if any, water and food sources | 20  |
:Foraging

A successful roll yields 1d6 worth of food. Food is maximum 2 per slot.

#### Foraging for herbs and fungi
Difficulty for the check is based on the environment by the referee. Sometimes finding an herb or fungus will be impossible. 

On a success, roll 2d6 on the herbs and fungus table and 1d4 to determine how many you find. All herbs are a maximum of 5 per slot. 

| Result | Herb, Fungus (1d4/5) | Appearance and properties                                          |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 3      | Heartsbane (fungus)  | Red powdery fungus. Blood coagulant, toxic                         |
| 4      | Sightleaf            | Leafy green herb. Heightens sight                                  |

| 7      | Feverfew             | White petal flower. Reduces fever                                  |
| 8      | Honeyfoil            | Broad green leafy herb, orange pistils. Expectorant                |
| 9      | Devilsgrace (fungus) | Purple mushroom cap, secreting black liquid. Sleep-inducing, toxic |
| 10     | Starcomb             | Brown conical seed. Heightens all senses                           |

### Wilderness Encounters
At the end of every watch, roll 1d6. 

| d6  | Result                                                                                                                                         |

| 2   | Fatigue. Each character suffers 1 point of direct damage unless they rest on the next watch. Ignore while camping.                             |
| 3   | Signs. Characters find signs of an encounter (based on encounter tables and environment).                                                      |
| 4   | Weather. Roll again on the weather table.                                                                                                      |
| 5   | Depletion. Each character rolls 1d10 + 10 and loses the item in that slot. They must spend the next watch recovering it. Ignore while camping. |
| 6   | Nothing happens.                                                                                                                                               |

:Encounter Vibe Check


### Camping 
A safe short or long rest in the wilderness with watches restores L x d6 of grit. 

# Combat 

## Initiative 
The characters roll 1d6. On a 4 and above, the player characters go first; on a 3 and below, the enemy goes first. Creatures on each side go at the same time, deciding and declaring their actions together. Initiative is re-rolled every round. 

**Optional rule: Dex check against enemy dex score.** Alternatively each character must roll +dex against the dexterity defense of the enemy with the highest dexterity defense. Every character who rolls at or above that number goes ahead of the enemies, while every character who rolls under that number goes after the enemies. Initiative is not re-rolled. 

## Turns 
Turns consist of movements and actions. Reactions may also occur during the opposing turn when relevant. Movement away from an enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity unless the enemy has a skill that says it does. 

Movement is 40 feet, typically. A single action may be performed which could be

- a melee or ranged attack
- reloading a crossbow 
- casting a spell (Refer to **Magic**)
- doing a stunt
- taking something out of your inventory
   - roll +dex versus the DC equal to the item's position in your inventory. On a success, you do the action for free and can take another action. On a failure, you retrieve the item anyway. 
- moving again
- intimidate (when the opposing side has half or fewer enemies left)
- give an order to retainers

Or anything else the referee may deem acceptable. 

### Attacking
Melee attacks may be made within 5-10 feet. Ranged attacks cannot be made within melee range. Make a melee or ranged attack by rolling 1d20 and adding the relevant bonus (usually str, but sometimes int or dex). If this value is equal to or over the enemy's armored defense score, the attack hits. The attacker then rolls the weapon's damage die. 

#### Sundering Attack 
Before rolling damage for a melee attack, a character may choose to destroy their weapon in order to inflict double the dice in damage. 

#### Improvised Damage
Unarmed strikes inflict damage equal to the strength bonus (minimum 0).

Physical damage from small things can be measured in d4 (caltrops, spikes, ball bearings--trip damage)

Physical damage from big things can be measured in d6 (carts, bookshelves, folding chairs)

Elemental damage can be measured in d6 (acid, fire, frost)

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** If it is preferred to have all of the rolls player-facing, then when an enemy creature makes a melee or ranged attack, roll 1d20 + armored defense bonus against the defense of the ability the enemy is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits. 

### Morale checks
A player may request a morale check after certain breaking points: 

- A leader is killed 
- Half of their allies are killed 
- Half of their HP is reduced (if alone)
- Ambushed
- Attacked by something they fear

The requesting character must make a +wil check against the enemy leader's (or strongest remaining enemy's) willpower defense. On a success, the enemies surrender or rout; on a failure, the characters must wait for another breaking point to try again. 

### Retreating

A side may retreat on their turn. Choosing to retreat forces a check against the opponent's relevant defense, depending on the nature of the retreat. 

Concentration is broken and no other actions may be taken if a side chooses to retreat. On a successful retreat check, the character manages to escape. On a failed retreat check, they stop moving, unable to escape. Retreated characters move twice their speed in their chosen direction, as long as it is not through an enemy space. 

Any retainers or allies must make a wil save (morale) at disadvantage versus the strongest enemy's wil defense. On a failure, they rout and try to flee, often dying in the panic. 

#### Chase
1. Before anything else, a **pursued** may drop an item. If it is something a **pursuer** desires, roll willpower (morale) to see if the pursuer stops pursuit to take the item.
2. To flee or pursue, the party member with the lowest Dexterity in the party does an **opposed Dexterity save** against the enemy's Dexterity.
3. Find the difference between the rolled result and the Dexterity score. The player party gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed. The enemy gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed.
4. **A.** If the pursued are 5 steps ahead, they've lost the pursuers. If the player party has  
    successfully fled, check the enemy's morale to determine whether they search for the player party.  **B.** If the pursuers catch up to the pursued, the chase is over and the pursuers automatically win initiative.

Pursuit requires line of sight from the monster. If the characters are able to duck around a corner, the monster may avoid this combat. 

## Critical Hits
On a natural 20, an attack inflicts twice the dice in damage. On a natural 1, the attack may provide an opening to the opposing side, granting an advantageous position to the opposing side, unless it is mitigated by something else. 

## Advantage
Creatures gain advantage from advantageous situations, such as ambushes. 

When a creature has advantage, they may choose to perform a stunt and an attack at the same time. 

## Disadvantage 
Creatures suffer disadvantage from disadvantageous situations, such as being caught unawares or aiming at a creature that is behind partial cover. 

## Conditions
- Exhausted: Disadvantage on all rolls.
- Paralyzed
- Grappled: Speed is 0, disadvantage on all rolls except to break the grapple.
- Charmed: Acting friendly towards 
- Blind
- Deafened
- Stunned
