- unruly: internal factions that dislike one another, ambitions beyond loyalty

- cavalry: costly to maintain, hindered by certain terrain, fast
- infantry: slow
- ranged: fast, stealthy
- engineers: slow, vulnerable, unskilled at fighting
	- engineers can build bridges, traps, fortifications, siege engines, and more. With good pay and time, they can manage it.


**NOTE ON NPC ATTACKS**
The first attack on the heroes is always harmless. Present the monster as a threat attacking them but don't inflict harm. Just place the monster there and ask the heroes what they want to do. 

### Harming Structures

1-harm – 3-harm: cosmetic damage. Bullet holes, broken glass, scorch marks, chipped surfaces. 0-harm can blow through to inhabitants.

9-harm and more: destruction. Full harm can blow through to inhabitants, plus they can suffer additional harm as the building or structure collapses.
