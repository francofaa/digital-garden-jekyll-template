[[3240 Charisma]]

When you are trying to achieve something for the common good, roll +common. On a hit, you do it, spending 1 wealth. On 7-9, pick 1:
- It takes longer than expected
- It costs more than expected (1 wealth from each hero)

On a miss, both and the Herald picks one: 
- Something catastrophic happens
- The village is in want (all wants apply)
