# Genre
Genre: Horror, displacement, estrangement, outcast, refugee

You are set to be executed today. You have each committed the most heinous crime: believing something apart from the majority. 

Your people have been persecuted for your beliefs for a long time and in your village, that tension has finally come to a head with your execution. 

- How are you being put to death?
- What false charges have you been convicted for that brought you here, in addition to being a member of your religion?

1. What do you have to establish about your character in order to begin play?
2. What about your character remains constant throughout play, and what changes?
3. What do you leave for play to find out about your character? What about your character do you play to find out?



uncanny
eerie: You have a strange tag: 
- your eyes glow
- your hair floats as if though you are underwater
- your voice is doubled / doesn't match up with your lips










grit, augurs, cunning

One stat for how human you seem, one stat for how weird you get (from following your god):


When your weird is 0-3, you have access to spell casting; when your humanity is 0-3 you have access to different leader / village moves (inspire, organize, negotiate)

Veteran player maybe has "dark past" and that can be triggered for bad situations: like the spooky 

Your coins are:

## Village stats
- trust
- population
- food
- water
- land 
- crops

Starvation 

Some may depend on how satisfied your god is. Maybe that is added to your roll. Something must be given up if you are to succeed on a health roll for your settlement (if you have a fail or mixed?)

# Basic Moves
- You can start with the basic moves and then figure out what you want the stats to be

How to create moves: 
- What are you playing to find out? 
	- To what lengths will the heroes go to create their community, protect it, empower it, and stop anyone from hurting it again? 


Clarifying / escalating moves

Escalating / resolving moves

Hero agenda: 
- protect your people because no one else will 


Action moves: Player chooses the move and has the character take action to make it. 

Check moves: Player chooses the action, GM decides whether you make the move. 

Save moves: GM chooses and calls for the  player to make move, which is not determined by the character action 

# GM stuff
- job:
	- Keep things believable 
	- Make the people monstrous and the monsters people 
	- Don't create solutions. Play to find out how far the heroes will go. 
	- Uncover the mysteries of their religion as the heroes uncover them. 

- rules
	- Prep and follow your prep
	- Give the players the full benefit of their moves and other resources 
	- Be reliable on what the characters see, hear, and experience. 

- principles
	- Make the characters feel outcast
	- Make the world cruel but hopeful
	- The heavens want to be worshiped and appeased

- moves
	- Have a villager or a loved one do something desperate or misguided
	- Have a monster reveal something about itself 
	- Have the heavens unveil something to the characters 
	- Have a monster tighten its grip on a villager or place
	- Have an oppressor test the characters 


# Additional Systems 
- Village stats
- omens / fortunes (something that you have from the gods, maybe like luck points that you can earn and spend)
- strings?
- bonds?

Different characters have different access to different resources or they can have character moves for the same 


character improvement: 
- If you fail on a village roll, you all gain xp but succeeding gets you material stuff or winds back the clock or prevents the clock from going forward 
- weapons systems
- research systems 
- telling fortunes  systems 
- researching magic systems 
- system for passage of time / generations 
- system for movements of armies
- system for goals and appetites of the NPCs


# 3 Questions of Gameplay
1. What do we establish before play?
2. What remains constant through play and what changes?
3. What do we need play alone to establish and what do we play to find out?
