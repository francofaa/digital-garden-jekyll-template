When out of view of gods you can stray  

Maybe when you commit to the god you have a true name curse on you 

Who are the gods? :::: pantheon, nature spirits, monotheism, god of many aspects, god and demiurge , ancestors 


the god communicates in vague signs (raven tower)


Your god is : 
- jealous 
- benevolent 
- requires sacrifices 
- etc
- Sends you omens, can be displeased 
- has one specific benefit 



The more worshipers you have for your god, the more pleased the god is
