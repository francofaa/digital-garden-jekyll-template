- Infirmary: Get a crew of two apprentices. Get 1-wealth when you spend time treating patients. (You need a supplier)
- Battlefield grace: While you are treating people, you have +1 armor
- Lay on hands: roll +eerie, heal 1, 7-9: open your mind to omens and roll that; miss: no healing and you both are exposed to the far shore
- scry with innards, (maybe just the basic magic move); vague weal or woe kind of stuff (when you have an unconscious body you can also scry)


HEALING SUPPLIES: 2 wealth per 1 stock of medicine ; if you have a supplier, you get +1 stock every session (if it makes sense, or at the start of every arc?)

- bloodlust: when you are hurt, you deal one extra damage 
- physician: you are a healer when you have a herbalism pack / healing pack

- immortal memory: tap into the aether and see all of the memories of the dead from this place; ask them anything; they unfurl before you like a parchment ; 2d6, mix success you don't get who you were looking for (?)

- beast speech: you can talk to animals 
- skinwalker : you can use the skin of a creature as a disguise to transform yourself into that creature , but your real skin is scabbed and foul
