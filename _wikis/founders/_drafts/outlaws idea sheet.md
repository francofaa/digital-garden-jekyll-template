## Milieu 
- Arriving conflict , neighboring armies 
- everyone has their own village or tenants ? 
- feudalism ! 
- But then a more powerful invader arrives 
- Crucified person ? 

Stats 
- Reputation 
- Income (maybe should be actual income? Or barter?)



Abandoned mine, abandoned monastery / vineyard, caves, catacombs, woods 



## Character ideas: 
- Cunning woman (makes money from abortions and potions)
- Disgraced abbot
- Runaway nun or monk 
- folk hero 
- bandit / murderer / commoner 
- disgraced noble 
- selkie with stolen skin 
- new werewolf 
- new vampire
- banished fey 

# Other ideas 

You play a vampire, there are memory tokens you take as your life extends one way and another 


Maybe there are no weapons? Harm just happens ? Until you become unstable? So the monsters have low harm or you can only hurt them by attacking their weakness


Maybe blue beard style? Like stories or something? 

Vampire story where two groups are awakening at different times. They have to finish quests before sunrise. It's the dead of winter. One group are day walkers or something where they are cursed by nightfall
Or something. 

Create optional feats and curses 

Makers: some of the characters are maker vampires? One team is and one team isn't 

Blood magic ? 

Motw kind of game. 
Familiars. 
Ok yeah you're all occult creatures. But it's monster of the week. 


# Yet more ideas 

You are a religious refugee, for some charge, you and your family are declared outlaws and must flee 
- perhaps it is a real crime, a made up charge, a small crime, or a mob at your door

Area: has mine to delve into, ruins, 

Threats:

Silvered weapons are difficult to come by 
All monsters have a specific weakness that you must discover 

Your god is : 
- jealous 
- benevolent 
- requires sacrifices 
- etc
- Sends you omens, can be displeased 
- has one specific benefit 

Your village has stats
- population
- Food
- Water 
- arable land 
- harvest / weather / climate / terrain 
- crops 
- traders that come by 
- on a major road (probably not)
- needs a house of worship 

The more worshipers you have for your god, the more pleased the god is 

Vibe: crones from the Witcher 

Make hand-drawn maps

Stats: weird

Seasonal events:
- summer : campaigns, deserters, bandits etc 
- autumn: obviously halloween kind of stuff 
- winter: Krampus, ghosts, frost maidens, yetis

Look into knave 
Stats rolling 

Limited item slots

Character creation should be streamlined 
Maybe adjective columns for weird weapons ; scavenged weapons 

Four sided dice for every ability score 
Doubles, you get extra stuff 

Spell books should be items that you find and that is what you have ; everyone can use it 

Spell books should be in game artefactos that you find and have titles and stuff and should be themed somehow 

Mordheim and Arkham horror : permanent injuries 

Rolling 1, something catastrophic happens when you fail magic 

Flavor stuff:
- places item: read books! Read the books you have ; skim a bunch of books to generate ideas 
- miscast.co: word bank system for words that you think are interesting in order to pull things together in a neat way 
- encyclopedias for interesting locations
- books on antiques to have books on statues, items, charms, and so on 
- monsters should have stories attached to them ; monsters make their own stories
- draw these things, it'll be more fun that way to make that flavor 

Tool for collaborative world building 
Ask the players where they're from. Places they heard rumors. Places they've heard about. Ask them about weird forbidden places

Starvation: you are unstable 

Dark devotion 

Luck comes from acts of  faith 

When out of view of gods you can stray  

Rock salt 

Monster weaknesses 

Kidnapping trap
