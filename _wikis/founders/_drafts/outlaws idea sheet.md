The godspoken 


Make hand-drawn maps

Seasonal events:
- summer : campaigns, deserters, bandits etc 
- autumn: obviously halloween kind of stuff 
- winter: Krampus, ghosts, frost maidens, yetis 
- spring: spring rites, sacrifices (human and animal)

Look into knave 
Stats rolling 


Character creation should be streamlined 
Maybe adjective columns for weird weapons ; scavenged weapons 

Four sided dice for every ability score 
Doubles, you get extra stuff 

Mordheim and Arkham horror : permanent injuries 


Flavor stuff:
- places item: read books! Read the books you have ; skim a bunch of books to generate ideas 
- miscast.co: word bank system for words that you think are interesting in order to pull things together in a neat way 
- encyclopedias for interesting locations
- books on antiques to have books on statues, items, charms, and so on 
- monsters should have stories attached to them ; monsters make their own stories
- draw these things, it'll be more fun that way to make that flavor 

Tool for collaborative world building 
Ask the players where they're from. Places they heard rumors. Places they've heard about. Ask them about weird forbidden places




    Book of Secrets - To keep track of secrets, symbols, passwords my players have discovered or to invent new ones on the fly.
