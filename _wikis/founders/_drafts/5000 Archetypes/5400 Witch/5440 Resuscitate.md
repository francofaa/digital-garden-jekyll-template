Spend 2 stock. They come back, but you get to choose how. Choose from the normal list, or pick 1: 
- They come back with a prosthetic (describe it)
	- Strengths: fine-tuned, responsive, comfortable, formidable, easily-maintained, interchangeable components, integrated with the meat, strong, untiring
	- Weaknesses: slow, heavy, itchy, hot, complicated harness, needs constant tinkering, slips, locks up, insensitive, requires fuel, loud
- You and they both come back at +1 eerie and -1 common.

If you don't have the stock, you may perform a dark ritual to return them to life. If this is the case, all player characters must work together to perform this ritual and all of you return at +1 eerie and -1 common.
