When you use medicine on an unstable target, roll +stock to heal them. On a hit, stabilize them and restore all hits past the stable line. On a 10+, choose 2; 7-9, choose 1:
- The medicine makes them babble the truth, and you ask them for a secret
- Recover 1 stock as they respond well to the medicine
- You learn something about your healing arts. Mark experience. 
- They owe you

On a miss, they take 1 harm instead. 

You can spend 1 stock to stabilize and treat an NPC

Use [[5421 Medical supplies]] to treat your patients.
