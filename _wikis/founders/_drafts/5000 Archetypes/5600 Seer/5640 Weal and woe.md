Take +1 forward to prevent it coming true and mark experience if you stop it. 7-9, you get cloudy visions of something that is yet to come: mark experience if you stop it. On a miss, you get a vision of something bad happening to you and the Herald holds 3 to spent to apply -1 penalties to your rolls.
