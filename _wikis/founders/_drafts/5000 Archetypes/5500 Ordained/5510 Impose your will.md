When you are trying impose your will on a group of villagers (against their instincts and self-interests), roll +common. On a 10+, all 3. On a 7-9, choose 1.
- they do what you want (otherwise they refuse)
- they don't fight back over it (otherwise they do fight back)
- you don't have to make an example of one of them (otherwise you must)

On a miss, someone in the village makes a bid, idle or otherwise, to replace you as village leader.
