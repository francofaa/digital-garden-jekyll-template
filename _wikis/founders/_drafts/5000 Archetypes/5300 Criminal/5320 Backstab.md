When you attack someone with a subtle weapon (blade, arrow, dart, needle) without their knowing, roll +cunning. On a hit, inflict harm as established. 10+ both. 7-9, pick one:
- You inflict double damage
- You do it without being noticed

On a miss, the target sees you coming and you exchange harm as normal.
