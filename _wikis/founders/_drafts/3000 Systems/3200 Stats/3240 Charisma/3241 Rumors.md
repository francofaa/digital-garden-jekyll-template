[[3240 Charisma]]

When you are trying to find something out about somebody, roll +common. On a 10+, ask 3. 7-9, ask 1. 
- How are they doing?
- What or who do they love best?
- Who do they know, like, and/or trust?
- When should I expect to see them again? 
- How could I get to them, physically or emotionally?
On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but they find out about your interest in them.
