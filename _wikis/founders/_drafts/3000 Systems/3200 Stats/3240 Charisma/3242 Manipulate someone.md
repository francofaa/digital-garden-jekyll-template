[[3240 Charisma]]

When you seduce, bluff, manipulate, fast-talk or lie, tell them what you want them to do, give them a reason:
- 10+ they’ll go with you until/unless a fact or action betrays the reason you gave them
- 7-9, they’ll go along with you, but need concrete assurance, corroboration, or evidence
