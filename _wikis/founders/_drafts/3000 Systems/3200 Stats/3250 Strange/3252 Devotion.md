[[3250 Strange]]

When you begin a session or have recently worshipped your god, provided a sacrifice, or held a festival, choose 1 aspect, and choose someone to lead the rites and roll +eerie. +10 both. 7-9, pick one, but the god also indulges in the relevant caprice: 
- boon 
- miracle

Miss, your god indulges in all of its caprices, not just the one related to the aspect you rolled.

The miracle is granted to the [[2100 Village]] while the boon is granted to the roller.
