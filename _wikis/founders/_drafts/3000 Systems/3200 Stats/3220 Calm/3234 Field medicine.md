[[3220 Calm]]

When someone is injured, you can perform first aid by rolling +cool. On a hit, you heal 1 harm and stabilize the target. 7-9, pick one:
- Stabilize the injury without healing harm but the target takes -1 forward ongoing
- Heal 1 harm and stabilize for now, but it will return as 2-harm and become unstable later
