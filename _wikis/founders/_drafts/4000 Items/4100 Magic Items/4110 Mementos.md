title: 4110 Mementos
---

The game starts with your execution. You are rescued from your execution by divine intervention from [[2200 Your God]]. They leave you with a memento depending on the method of execution. 

- Hanging
	- **Noose**. 10 feet of rope that can be solidly affixed to an object. A command word fuses and separates the noose end from the object.
- Burned at the stake
	- **Cinder**. Can provide warmth and/or light at *close* range using a command word.
- Beheading
	- **Axe**. A thirsting blade that inflicts 4-harm magical hand. Once a victim is killed, the blade seeks another victim. *Act under pressure* to stop yourself from attacking. The blade speaks to whoever is holding it.
- Riddled with arrows
	- **Arrow**. A magic glass-tipped arrow that drains blood from a creature. A command word can be used to drain the blood from the glass tip and restore one harm.
- Nailed to cross
	- **Nails**. Embedded nails can be used as magnets to draw metal objects toward you. When you speak the command word, roll +eerie. On a hit, it comes to you. 7-9, pick one: Too quickly or too slowly. Miss, the nails turn on you.
- Drinking poison
	- **Toxic blood**. If a creature tries to drink your blood, it takes harm. If you are unstable (and bleeding), touching your wounds inflicts 1 harm intimate. This includes anyone trying to heal you if they are not careful.
- Stoning
	- **Floating rock**. Can be thrown in midair and made to stay still or fall using a command word.
- Drowning
	- **Vial of water**. Can be used to divine the location of a monster, using a command word to activate and deactivate. When a monster is near, it boils. 
- Death by a thousand cuts
	- **Healing blade**. Can be used to heal cuts for 1 harm and stabilize. When it is used to heal, it reverts to a knife (1 harm hand) until dawn.
