(Some ideas are from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ElPb31rsmZN7UUUoWIEUTFIvYH-6VZ3r/view)

- magical eye but you have to replace your eye with it 
- stone dagger: creature that is stuck with this is turned to the stone. Removing dagger instantly brings them back to life. Cutting with a dagger is easier than sticking a dagger into someone 
- tongue of the false prophet: cast spells, maybe languages? the catastrophic failure is worse 
- two headed silver rings: communication rings, spoken in whispers
- sever rings: rings that hop to your fingers if you chop them off, until finally landing on your throat and wrapping around your throat; cursed but should have a positive aspect but should have a bad thing too 
- holy water: boils when a vampire is near 
- flash orb: a light source. if dropped, explodes and blinds those nearby 
- deathmask: stolen from a priest's sarcaphagous, placing it on a corpse lets you see the cause of death 
- devilsgrace: lets you recover all sickness and damage and fall into a dark dreamless sleep; may be disturbing for some. catatonic 2 hours. overdosing causes massive hallucinations
- doom compass: points to the most dangerous thing in your life
- fishing spear: always hits a fish in a lake 
- heartseeker bow
- resonance blade
- red blindfold: lets you see heartbeats in splashes of red but otherwise your vision becomes black and white lines 
- hex doll: stores a spell inside of it that you have cast. you need hair or blood from a living person. tear  off a limb  to cast the spell instantly. the spell always works but roll 2d6 + magic stat (?), fail: the hex doll's link is maimed in the same way as the doll. 
- oubliette key: opening any door with this key leads you into a 10 x 10 stone room, which can only be opened from the outside. only has 24 hours of air 
- rope that becomes rigid as steel on command 
- a bell that makes a 10 foot bubble of silence 
-
