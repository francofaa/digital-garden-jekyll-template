Rolling 1, something catastrophic happens when you fail magic 

Spell books should be items that you find and that is what you have ; everyone can use it 

Spell books should be in game artefactos that you find and have titles and stuff and should be themed somehow 
    Book of Magic - I thought this might be a nice way of giving players new spells.
