# Cheat sheet

## Starting Year 2
1. Discard half your cards, rounding down
2. Draw 5 cards
	1. Draw an additional card if you have the most influence tokens face-up 
3. Bid for first position (phalanx, double envelopment, Hannibal, Marcus, and Lucius follow their special powers) and Lenisian player wins ties

## Turn

1. Play 0-2 cards facedown
	1. 0 cards: Discard and draw the same number of cards plus 1. 
	2. 1 card: Move up to 3 armies. In lieu of movement, you may rally an area you control.
	3. 2 cards: Move all available armies. Rally once. Discard an additional card to make a forced march (move 1 extra space)

## Movement

- Armies of 1-4 units may move 3 spaces
- Armies of 5-6 units may move 2 spaces
- Armies of 7-8 units may move 1 space
- Armies of more than 8 units cannot move (and cannot force march)

## Rallying

Newly rallied troops cannot move this turn. 

Rally the full number of units that appear in an area.

- 2 units per rally: city-states, Bathradi Mercenaries
- 1 unit per rally: Lenisian reinforcements
- 1 unit + 1 navy per rally: Lenisian reinforcements + Lenisian navy joint space
- 1 navy: every port

## Influence

If an army passes through a neutral city-state, the player may place an influence token face-down in the city-state. This is token is considered to not be active until the influence resolution phase.

Any inactive influence tokens may be flipped to active if at the end of the turn: 
- a friendly army is in or next to the city-state and
- there are no enemy armies in an adjacent land territory to the city-state
