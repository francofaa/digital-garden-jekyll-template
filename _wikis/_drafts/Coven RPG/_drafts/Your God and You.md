## Faith and God Moves

- Praising an aspect
  - Offer a sacrifice to your god or hold a festival in their honor costing 100 coins to host, choose 1 aspect and roll +faith. On a 10+, both; 7-9, choose 1 but the god also indulges in a caprice or inflicts a curse on a character with less faith:
    - boon
    - miracle
  - On a miss, the god indulges in **all** of their caprices, or inflicts their curse.

- Curses: When a god has cursed a character, the character rolls at disadvantage for the specified skill until the character does something to appease the god.

Ways to gain faith:

- If you are cursed and do not curse or abandon your god, you gain 1 faith at the end of the day.
- If you successfully praise all 3 aspects in 1 week, you gain 1 faith.

The god must be praised at least once a week. Otherwise, all of the characters will be cursed.

Ways to lose faith: 

- If you abandon or curse your god and do not repent, you lose 1 faith at the end of the day.
- If you do not praise an aspect every week, you lose 1 faith.
