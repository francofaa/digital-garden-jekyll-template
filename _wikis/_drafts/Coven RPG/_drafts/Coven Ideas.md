# Coven!
Tell us about the town 

Limit backgrounds, turn on encumbrance, draw the town, let the heroes come up with their own ideas for the town and the type of people that live there, make a map of the region (godsbody through to Gomotesc)

Choose the season the game starts in; it takes a full season to gather supplies, money, to make an expedition to each of the dungeons so the heroes have to choose when they go to a certain place. There will be separate seasonal occasions as the heroes start trying to learn how to use their powers (leveling up) and figure out what kind of people live in the village, their relationships, and the invasions of interlopers

They must all return to their hometown

You must all be human warlocks, but you start as commoners as we determine the hometown you are all from. 

- Why did you leave home? What did you hope to find?
- How did the townspeople learn of your worship?
- How did they try to kill you?


a monster, its lair, and itâ€™s most recent victim

you bear a scar and a memento 

Religious organization is coming to your hometown next (they are a violent mercenary group that is disguised as religion, Christian like): you have to collect the artefacts to prepare for their arrival; it has been foretold by your deity 

whatever subclass of warlock you choose, think about how the gift supersedes some failing you have already. For example, if you choose hexblade, maybe your character is physically weak or sickly. 

God becomes more powerful the more stuff you find and get for it; you have to make material sacrifices; establish what your god does first and then it begins to branch into other areas

subclasses, one apiece ; use the witches in those pics 

you'll get to make your background and your origin, but your heroic origin will be role-played. 


is there a one-player rpg that can let me generate a world / city ?

groats (other forms of currency?) just go by coppers only 

no healing potions or other high magical items (healing potions can be brewed by the witches but it is costly and the potions are temporary and inflict long-term repercussions)

Number of spells you can cast per day is equal to 1d4 per level

reading someone's magical tome: the villain will likely have curses in there to fool you; everything is probably in a magical code language 

the heroes have to fight off a hag (you only wear the trappings of my kind)

Use "A familiar feeling" for familiar building prompts 

use map that you made in map building game for the map for the location 



when a hero is bloodied, there is some complications to the situation 



Your bare feet covered by water, steam rising from your mouth and nostrils.

A fistful of hair torn from your head, thrown upon a flame.

A steady rhythm drummed against something resonant, continuing after you've stopped.

Obscene symbols drawn in concentric circles around you.

You must be naked to cast the spell, not a thread touching your body.

You must swallow a living creature whole.

Flagellation.

A shivering, shaking dance in a mentally-induced fever.

Hot wax poured upon your head, running down your face.

The tips of your fingers slit, wrists pressed together and brought to your face to mark a circle of blood.

Your mouth filled with dirt, exhuming the incantation.

Let no sentient creature enter your sight, let your eyes never close.

Plunge your hands beneath the soil, let the worms twist their bodies about your fingers.

Drink the blood of another.

Intermittent regurgitation, the pool of vomit churning into a swirling spire that streams back into your mouth at the culmination of the spell.

A spider held on the tongue, swallowed after casting.

Urinate in the dust and dirt, take the acidic taste upon the tip of your tongue, spit the final word.

Take the knife to your belly, spill your vitals, the wound will close when the casting is done.  
_(Unless you rolled maximum damage, which means you cut too deep, the wound remains.)_

Hold your hand in the flame of a candle until the casting is done.

No blood may be spilt in your presence while the incantation is performed. Make a _[Cast the Bones](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/do-not-take-me-for-some-turner-of-cheap-tricks/)_ roll for every wound you witness.

- Aegerlings: Invaders from over the sea (exonym) / / also called Outlanders / endonym is Attalander / they come from Attaland
- Otani: "Foreigners", original inhabitants of the island of Isurholm (they call it Galolis)
- Isuri: inhabitants, descended from old invaders / Galoli (exonym, means foreigner, which the Otani call them)
- Disirlings: The ancient forerunners who first conquered Isurholm, thought to be giants (called themselves the Disiri)
- Piastro: The nation across the sea, descendants of the Disiri


You have to have a reason to return home at some point but you are forced to after the catastrophe happens to you 


Christianity like religion, demands obedience

Druidic religions (Otani, very few of them, most of them have converted to the dead god)
- Aegerlings: Amfris-who-flies-above, war god, plus a fertility god

Blacksmith often makes deal with the devil : they extract steel from stone ; sick people were taken to their anvils ; some blacksmiths were canonized
