# Nun Amok / Heretics game
The heroes are young teenage girls who started learning about a mysterious god; they were caught doing some strange ritual and banished to a distant nunnery

What was the ritual?

How did you get caught and who caught you?

The god warns you of a invading army coming in three months time and that if you want to protect your community, you must become stronger 

Make all the nun characters and locals

The MCs don't understand 

vampires but like new england ones 

maybe incorporate your thousand year old vampire 

you gotta play artefact to get those artefacts
