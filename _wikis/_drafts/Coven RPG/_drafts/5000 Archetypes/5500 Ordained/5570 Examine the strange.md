When you evaluate a magical creature or artifact, roll +eerie. On a hit, you know its name (if noteworthy) or which category it belongs to. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 2:
- What vulnerabilities does it have?
- What rules or taboos must it obey?
- What powers does it have? What makes it dangerous?
- What is the character of its magic?
- Who does it serve, or to what is it aligned?
