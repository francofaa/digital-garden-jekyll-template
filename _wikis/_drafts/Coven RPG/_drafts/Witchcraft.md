# Various and sundry notes on witchcraft

"The elements of spellcasting" - everything matters but not everything is necessary

cleanse protect banish attract 

do divination before casting a spell

Do not be your main battery

write everything down: questions, manifestations, readings, spells, dreams, ideas

The Earth is divine and humans are part of the Earth (rather than humans and the divine being apart from the earth).
