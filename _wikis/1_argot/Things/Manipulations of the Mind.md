The book is an assortment of hag recipes and spells, crude and incomprehensible. However, there is a page in here that contains writing in a different hand, detailing a formula with diagrams. A letter falls out as you try to make sense of the diagrams. It reads:

> Dear Arry,
>
> Apologies for the last one, but the fiends will be hunting us anyway. We may as well get some use out of the equipment.
>
> I have enclosed here the recipe for mind control. I have transcribed it and improved it from the Rakshasaâ€™s hand. It is a dangerous one, so take care not to overuse it on those you need it to work on. It may cause madness or even undeath.
>
> I await your rescue boat tomorrow. I can only shield my mind for so long. The Rakshasa is close to finding me out.
>
> Yours truly,
>
> Nat
