title: Malorys spellbook
---

An eldritch tome which is likely one of the sources of Natalya's [[Interpretations of the Many-Bodied]], which was given to Aramestes so that he could become [[The Deathless One]]. 

In [[It is Dark and Hell is Hot]], Malory discovered the origins of the spellbook and its life across the centuries.
