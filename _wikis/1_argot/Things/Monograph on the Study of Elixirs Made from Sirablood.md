# Monograph on the Study of Elixirs Made from Sirablood

*Book from [[Mother Clotcarver]] on Quebra*

*Spells in this spellbook were destroyed by a fireball*

This is a small book, leather-bound with fanciful drawings around the pages. At first it appears to be a full monograph, detailing the experiments and trial and error that led at last to a single solitary formula at the end of the book. There is a letter in the back, brief. It reads:

> Aramestes,

> After months of trial and error, we have finally found a new use for sirablood. The elixir will give your troops a temporary boost in vitality. We lost a lot of our best to find this one out. It may be some time before I have the heart to start new trials. I hope you understand.
