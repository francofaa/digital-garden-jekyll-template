title: you cant have any pudding until youve had your BONES

[[Sora Nemmonis]] awakens to [[Melody]] and aÂ  gang of kids accusing her of lying to them about being able to bring [[Auntie Stitchmouth]] back to life. Instead the hag touching the holy waters of the fountain resulted in the curse coming back. 

[[Baltsaros]] comes to the heroes, weeping over [[Abraham Washington]] as the hero coughs up blood from his old war wounds. The [[Kodama]] bring the heroes to a grove where [[Rho]], an ancient idol, has slept for unknown centuries. She stabilizes Abraham, but it is clear that Abe must convalesce here for some time before returning and exacting vengeance on [[Hespero]] and [[The Deathless One]]. Princess [[Roswyn]] agrees to care for Abe and Baltsaros in the meantime, put them to work when they are able to pay off their debt, and also those kids from Findalos? They charm and enslave them. Just can't catch a break. 

[[Hobbes]] is able to convince the crew of the [[PS Admirable Effort]] to continue working with them, thankfully saving Sora from having to bribe everyone. 

[[Know-it-all Nausicaa]] is startled by the sudden appearance of Hespero in her mirror. Hespero pretends that they have been missing for 10 years, and upon discovering where they've ended up, the old fiend mocks the heroes.

"Are you all just going to stay there? Or are you coming back ? Oh that's where he sent you? What a character. Much as I wanted your help in the war against Mineos, it's all too fitting you ended up in the place I ditched all the other rejects who failed me."

He confirms the heroes' suspicions that the demiplane engine is within the bodies of three creatures in the 13 Islands. He says they can turn it off and come back to help him with the war against Mineos, and then he will kill them later. He also seems to know who Malory is. 

The heroes arrive on Osteros, meeting the Nommonis clan, who seem to have split off from Sora's clan 600 years ago, 100 years before the founding of the Werriadi Republic. One of the guards who meets them suddenly becomes an eldritch horror, filled with worms and larvae. 

[[Agga]], the victim's friend, takes them to their priest [[Kalak]]. They are shocked by the worm thing, but upon Livius telling them of the heroes' quest to free the islands by helping each of the residents of the islands in turn, Kalak humbly asks them to help in eradicating the undead from Osteros. One of their adventurers, [[Olos]], went down into the Crypt of Aramestes, so-called for several centuries, though no one knows who truly lies there. The heroes are skeptical since their theory is that the Deathless One is Aramestes, and that guy is for sure alive. Unsure what horror awaits them there, the heroes agree to help. 

They feast on a goat that Sora accidentally killed and head off for the ruined city in the morning. Agga and her companions fight off the skeletons, buying enough time for the heroes to delve into the crypt. Upon entering, they hear a voice, taunting them: 

"Welcome travelers, to your doom! So you seek your fortune, but you will perish here in the dust! Unless you can solve all of my secrets and reach my treasure room. Will you survive? Will I be here to watch? Stay tuned!"

They go through one of six doors, finding their path back blocked after going through. A host of skeletons meet them, seeking flesh to wear on their bones. A pud is there too, but he don't do much.
