# To do before game and questions
1. At the beginning of the session, tell everyone to come up with a fear and a hope
2. Plan for Hespero encounter
3. Teach the gang how to play the war game 
4. Suggest that they kill at least one of the Mineosi generals
5. Do we have minis for everyone?
6. Can we get minis for some monsters for the big game?
7. Campfire game
8. Level up at the campfire 
9. Print off some stickers for the characters

WHAT is the fallout of killing Hespero? Multiplanarly that is?

Hobbes is hunted for violating a rakshasa's absolution





------


doomwakers are going to spray their breath weapon and start breaking through the walls


sora is on the end of day five after finding this stuff out and the others are on the end of day 6 (late at night now)

DONT FORGET ABOUT GENERAL BEREN and the HECKERS

DONT FORGET CALANTHA'S PLAN IS TO KILL THE TRIUMVIRS AND DESTROY THE PONTIA LEGION

REMEMBER 

**Do you guys have anything on you that was made with sirablood?**!!!! If they pick up any of that ichor, it would undo teh sirablood in the device 


Sora could run into the Duchess in the streets
- maybe the duchess wants to ask what else she can get her 

DAY SIX: Ralos checks in on her; the legion shows up so Ralos sends a runner after her 

HESPERO WOULD SUGGESTION + GEAS SORA: Saying nothing, leave Argot and never return and go far away from here, return to Werriad and speak nothing to anyone. 




**MAKE THE SOULCAGE FOR THE DEATHLESS ONE**



Serena runs into sora  

Bread lines 

Dragon racism 


(Next time: Krump should be at the dinner party too, along with Serena in a small form)


should be day 45
















---



Make maps for game - for different quadrants 

Make missions in the Argot campaign: like 7 of them, each of them has worsening conditions based on if the heroes decide to act and they are all mutually exclusive outcomes

Individual missions 

Sora to murder Leandro 

Hobbes to murder the bargainer 


---



Hespero recounts whatâ€™s been happening 

---



Sora's ends justify the means. Make an omelette. Hobbes is the egg that gets cracked




RULES: what is it? morale checks, resource checks artillery cant hit when it's too close



Ask Shade more about Gary the star spawn, make him necessary for Mallory to fight 

---

If Nahk binds one of the Deathless Ones, the Deathless One will hear and see what the heroes do (and will therefore have an idea of where they are)


---





Write copy for each of the different tags, interactions, etc

Hespero has Oret automaton bodyguards

```ad-note
I figured this would be a collaborative thing; i.e. if there's something you'd like, but wouldn't make sense for Hespero to have, maybe Oret provides it. However, I can say that Oret will only aid in exchange for the creation (or start of construction) of a temple/casino dedicated to his worship in Argot. As time was pretty crunched, and shit was soon to hit the fan, I think he'd also accept a contractual agreement, drafted by Oret, of course. He'd provide the workers to build the casino temple, and these workers would act as soliders. I'm at work, and I don't have the details handy, but they are constructs that are hearty and have some chance based things and a recharge move called "The House Always Wins" which turns a roll into a 20. You could determine how many you want. I also have a theory crafted champion who I was going to introduce this year during Icosahedrodome, similar to Terokles, but devoted to Oret. She's a level 20 character who will bail if she is overwhelmed (so that I may potentially use her sometime as a PC). But she would be on the table

Deathless One 




Hespero's casino, Oret's aid -- who is he betting on ? 



Make sure that the stuff for the final battle is colorblind friendly

the mindflayer lawyer

Maybe just make different Deathless Ones?

Deathless One can consume an enemy, engulfing it in a grapple, to teleport it elsewhere (like a meazel); maybe that is a lair action?

KODAMA monsters

Give them XP based levels


From SORA:
```ad-note
Sora is still technically employed buy the Republic, which is looking to conquer. As soon as she's back in the MP, she'd like to immediately message her handler to give an update and set the Republic up to be the victors over the ashes of this little war.

She will use everyone and everything to her advantage. In an ideal world, she'd dream of convincing the Republic that she be installed as vassal queen over Argot, after the dust settles. In a realistic world, she expects that she's going to work to set the dragonborn up as the power behind some other chosen leader, possibly the Giants, Hespero, or the humans.

I'm torn between her outright sticking to the Republic and turning her back on the Republic for her friends. I'm goign to try to angle for a way that the friends "win," but Sora and the Republic win the most


Almsbrood and his wife are still alive but are on the run; the Duchess starts gathering all the giants who survived to her. Only 20% of the giants died and all but 25 of the smallfolk survived.

forever 21, complimenting each other 

abe and nahk are feeling themselves 

abe immediately solves the puzzle as kb grabs the orb 

crossbow attracts the alchemist to hobbes 

what do we do with a headless giant ? 

stay out of giant politics 

thats very big of you 


if i marry a bunch of giants its big of me

The sword Sora found on the dead paladin under Aurochs Island, which found its way into Nahk's paws, now is handed off to Livius.

Heroes are headed to Dorost 

The bugbears under Krump (even!) form a warband and take out the rest of the Rakshasas.

The heroes fight the rakshasa warriors until bakasura 

suggestion 

frieza v goku 

kill them all and let god sora them out 

livius forgot that he could cast fly 

kb thought about throwing his sword 

y ou didnt wait for me to drop my weapon 


owie-licious

the bug burier 






BAKASURA ENCOUNTER: 
- mass suggestion: take everything off, gives them rusty swords 
- begin combat: destructive wave, chromatic orb may replace one weapon attack 
- zakya rakshasas will use superiority die every turn 

Gerrik, leader of the bugbears, infected with rage virus



turns out it has started because the bugbears began drinking a sirablood contaminated water source

The rakshasas had started mining and the sirablood leaked in there

give them all what's happening on each of the islands in the next session:

There is a monstrous creature on Dorost that has awakened and it is fiendish

There is a fiendish creature in Nistora

There are fiends and undead on Charatos. There is a disease run rampant on Charatos

Move them along from the arguments, don't let them rehash it 

If Rho decides to leave, have Nausicaa spot Abe and Baltsaros flying toward them, Baltsaros says "You guys kept flying back and forth, we kept losing you, is everything OK?"


bugbears are infected with a rage virus, can be cured, turns them into undead but they can be brought back and healed

the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 

Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys

Malory becomes a boss monster, defeats the unspeakable one, not a great way unless he becomes sane 

before giving charon a peach, he would have spent a long time tripping balls in his past lives, absorbing them all 

---

The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

forgot to mention: serena lets you off, pins it all on paloma

show us the ugliness in the world

nistora cloud giant culture

- riffrick is a slaver and paloma worked with him
- duchess is not a slaver, read her mind
- duchess never actually attacked them 


Serena is going to be using telekinesis

Add Hespero's spells from the ico game and other attacks and capabilities (maneuverability, commanding other creatures, fly speed, 50 foot movement speed)

If the heroes take Hespero down into hell, they must fight Bel: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bel

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/erinyes: Hespero has three furies fighting for him 

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gold-forged-sentinel: Hespero's guardian beasts

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hundred-handed-one: another Hespero's employees, an artisan who is also his muscle 

One of Hespero's allies, runs his casino, is facilitating the construction of Oret's temple: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-sapphire-dragon





https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/doomwake-giant: This giant maybe appears and fights alongside the invading Mineosi representing the fears of the people

# Planning for the last arc of Argot

- Update the Deathless One. Make them uniquely capable of thwarting the heroes but them fight the deathless one first 
- Plan what Hespero is going to do 
- Plan what Natalya will do, see if you can wait until Nick is able to play as her because that will make it easier for me to not have to plan what she does depending on the heroes' actions 
- Plan for what Zulon does
- Have the heroes do a fate roll for their epilogue (Name a fear, name a desire; roll 2d6). Ask them their fear and desire before the final battle starts. They all start talking about it around the campfire maybe before they go into battle
- There should be an ending thing where there is someone from the East who talks about how there are great monsters to be destroyed out there, they traverse the wastes but at times will come down on the towns and villages there



- For when the kodama put an air bubble around the ship: Everyone just stares as the great shark flops helplessly on the deck
