How long as it been? You cannot say. Centuries, they tell you, but you never tire, your mind sharp as always with knowledge and cleverness but empty of memories. You have been at this puzzle for days, or weeks, or maybe it's also been centuries. This puzzle is much like the others: a black box, unknown, but it has a simple solution. It must.

But over the past few weeks, a different puzzle has tugged at you, one without a simple solution. And your heart, a pile of blackened ash, you feel it forming anew: not literally or materially but maybe somehow in the ether. Maybe. You were never much for metaphysics. You really only trusted the things you could touch and see. But you can touch and see them. Their furry and scaly and fleshy faces smiling at you, laughing with you. It seems to do something. 

Even though you can't feel the box or the key in your skinless hands, your mind sharpens and you understand. You follow the pattern from the diagram: the seven keys with different numbered teeth, turning in the lock one after the other, until at last the box comes apart, the puzzle reveals itself in a blinding white light. 

The box falls to the floor. Natalya, you awaken on a ship that is familiar to you, yet strange. You look at your hands and they are skin once more, and you touch your face and you are back. 

The memories all rush back and you feel a pain in your head, a stabbing headache, as you think about the puzzle, the one without the simple solution: What to do about Aramestes?



I am not a necro boy I am a necro man sir



the heroes must decide between killing the demonic presence who will be pathetic "please just free me, i will leave the demiplane, if you free me from these bonds i can regenerate my power in an instant and planeshift away forever, i swear it; they are just sapping my power; (if you kill me in this weakened state, i will not be able to survive--but he wouldnt tell them this necessarily) "

You delve into the pitch blackness of the sphere under Nistora. It is not magical darkness, but the walls of this sphere are completely black, and as you enter, you feel yourself begin to float. Nahk and anyone else with a light source, you are able to see your friends walk away from you, walking on the walls of the sphere without a sense of which way is up and which way is down. 


On the floor / walls are written the words of the curse

The demon Charagat is covered in the words of the curse. He is compressed into a tiny sphere, his limbs and wings and face contorted and pressed against the film of his sphere. It is translucent and appears to be 






Clouds as 
Earth as clouds





- Livius's runestone for Goremond
- The fiend in the black sphere: release me (does go away, Nistora still falls, kodama unhappy); kill me (is dead, kodama are happy, Nistora falls); leave alone (kodama unhappy, Nistora does not fall, status quo)
- There have to be SOME underground monsters; otherwise it's no fun! But not too crazy, enough so that they could conceivably think that they would need to reserve resources for a final boss fight which never has to come
- Come up with a fun rhyme for the spell that binds the fiend to Nistora that hints at the power the fiend puts into it (Stones and dirt do float as clouds); The names of giant heroes past that adventured to seal the demon away are written here (In great battle did fall such and such hero, other heroes survived, etc)






drop of pitch containing a devil that is keeping nistora afloat, set there by hespero, slaves also live on the island; devil inside that hates hespero and offers to help

the heroes will have to witness the enslaved of other islands doing stuff (great works and the like)

Almsbrood will tell them that long ago they captured a great fiend and placed him under the island to let it float. 

But note that the island is floating and the castle is floating on its own because it is made of magical clouds. They brought the island up in order to have some extra living space 

Show that the castle is made out of clouds and that the island is just kind of underneath it

Rho and the talkers will go to announce their presence at the city 

and the others will wait to see what happens before

Rho and Paloma have successfully convinced the tibbits to join with them against the Duchess. 



Natalya fell in love with Luigius

Abe best wizard, Luigius is the second best wizard

Abe is holding the charm

what do we do with a headless giant ? 

stay out of giant politics

My alchemical Necromance


The sword Sora found on the dead paladin under Aurochs Island, which found its way into Nahk's paws, now is handed off to Livius.

Heroes are headed to Dorost 

The bugbears under Krump (even!) form a warband and take out the rest of the Rakshasas.

suggestion 

frieza v goku 

kill them all and let god sora them out 

livius forgot that he could cast fly 

kb thought about throwing his sword 

y ou didnt wait for me to drop my weapon 


owie-licious

the bug burier 






BAKASURA ENCOUNTER: 
- mass suggestion: take everything off, gives them rusty swords 
- begin combat: destructive wave, chromatic orb may replace one weapon attack 
- zakya rakshasas will use superiority die every turn 

Gerrik, leader of the bugbears, infected with rage virus



turns out it has started because the bugbears began drinking a sirablood contaminated water source

The rakshasas had started mining and the sirablood leaked in there

give them all what's happening on each of the islands in the next session:

There is a monstrous creature on Dorost that has awakened and it is fiendish

There is a fiendish creature in Nistora

There are fiends and undead on Charatos. There is a disease run rampant on Charatos

Move them along from the arguments, don't let them rehash it 

If Rho decides to leave, have Nausicaa spot Abe and Baltsaros flying toward them, Baltsaros says "You guys kept flying back and forth, we kept losing you, is everything OK?"


bugbears are infected with a rage virus, can be cured, turns them into undead but they can be brought back and healed

the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 

Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys

Malory becomes a boss monster, defeats the unspeakable one, not a great way unless he becomes sane 

before giving charon a peach, he would have spent a long time tripping balls in his past lives, absorbing them all

The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

forgot to mention: serena lets you off, pins it all on paloma

Add Hespero's spells from the ico game and other attacks and capabilities (maneuverability, commanding other creatures, fly speed, 50 foot movement speed)

If the heroes take Hespero down into hell, they must fight Bel: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bel

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/erinyes: Hespero has three furies fighting for him 

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hundred-handed-one: another Hespero's employees, an artisan who is also his muscle 

One of Hespero's allies, runs his casino, is facilitating the construction of Oret's temple: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-sapphire-dragon

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gold-forged-sentinel: Hespero's guardian beasts



https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/doomwake-giant: This giant maybe appears and fights alongside the invading Mineosi representing the fears of the people

# Planning for the last arc of Argot

- Update the Deathless One. Make them uniquely capable of thwarting the heroes but them fight the deathless one first 
- Plan what Hespero is going to do 
- Plan what Natalya will do, see if you can wait until Nick is able to play as her because that will make it easier for me to not have to plan what she does depending on the heroes' actions 
- Plan for what Zulon does
- Have the heroes do a fate roll for their epilogue (Name a fear, name a desire; roll 2d6). Ask them their fear and desire before the final battle starts. They all start talking about it around the campfire maybe before they go into battle
- There should be an ending thing where there is someone from the East who talks about how there are great monsters to be destroyed out there, they traverse the wastes but at times will come down on the towns and villages there



- For when the kodama put an air bubble around the ship: Everyone just stares as the great shark flops helplessly on the deck
