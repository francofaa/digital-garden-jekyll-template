Almsbrood and his wife are still alive but are on the run; the Duchess starts gathering all the giants who survived to her. Only 20% of the giants died and all but 25 of the smallfolk survived. 




Natalya fell in love with Luigius 


Abe is holding the charm

Abe made it across 

nahk cooking idea 

forever 21, complimenting each other 

abe and nahk are feeling themselves 

abe immediately solves the puzzle as kb grabs the orb 

crossbow attracts the alchemist to hobbes 

what do we do with a headless giant ?

My alchemical Necromance


The sword Sora found on the dead paladin under Aurochs Island, which found its way into Nahk's paws, now is handed off to Livius. 

Goremand



Heroes are headed to Dorost 

The bugbears under Krump (even!) form a warband and take out the rest of the Rakshasas.

The heroes fight the rakshasa warriors until bakasura 

suggestion 

frieza v goku 

kill them all and let god sora them out 

livius forgot that he could cast fly 

kb thought about throwing his sword 

y ou didnt wait for me to drop my weapon 


owie-licious

the bug burier 






BAKASURA ENCOUNTER: 
- mass suggestion: take everything off, gives them rusty swords 
- begin combat: destructive wave, chromatic orb may replace one weapon attack 
- zakya rakshasas will use superiority die every turn 

Gerrik, leader of the bugbears, infected with rage virus



turns out it has started because the bugbears began drinking a sirablood contaminated water source

The rakshasas had started mining and the sirablood leaked in there

give them all what's happening on each of the islands in the next session:

There is a monstrous creature on Dorost that has awakened and it is fiendish

There is a fiendish creature in Nistora

There are fiends and undead on Charatos. There is a disease run rampant on Charatos

Move them along from the arguments, don't let them rehash it 

If Rho decides to leave, have Nausicaa spot Abe and Baltsaros flying toward them, Baltsaros says "You guys kept flying back and forth, we kept losing you, is everything OK?"


bugbears are infected with a rage virus, can be cured, turns them into undead but they can be brought back and healed

the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 

Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys

Malory becomes a boss monster, defeats the unspeakable one, not a great way unless he becomes sane 

before giving charon a peach, he would have spent a long time tripping balls in his past lives, absorbing them all

The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

forgot to mention: serena lets you off, pins it all on paloma

show us the ugliness in the world

- duchess is not a slaver, read her mind
- duchess never actually attacked them

Add Hespero's spells from the ico game and other attacks and capabilities (maneuverability, commanding other creatures, fly speed, 50 foot movement speed)

If the heroes take Hespero down into hell, they must fight Bel: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bel

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/erinyes: Hespero has three furies fighting for him 

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hundred-handed-one: another Hespero's employees, an artisan who is also his muscle 

One of Hespero's allies, runs his casino, is facilitating the construction of Oret's temple: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-sapphire-dragon

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gold-forged-sentinel: Hespero's guardian beasts



https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/doomwake-giant: This giant maybe appears and fights alongside the invading Mineosi representing the fears of the people

# Planning for the last arc of Argot

- Update the Deathless One. Make them uniquely capable of thwarting the heroes but them fight the deathless one first 
- Plan what Hespero is going to do 
- Plan what Natalya will do, see if you can wait until Nick is able to play as her because that will make it easier for me to not have to plan what she does depending on the heroes' actions 
- Plan for what Zulon does
- Have the heroes do a fate roll for their epilogue (Name a fear, name a desire; roll 2d6). Ask them their fear and desire before the final battle starts. They all start talking about it around the campfire maybe before they go into battle
- There should be an ending thing where there is someone from the East who talks about how there are great monsters to be destroyed out there, they traverse the wastes but at times will come down on the towns and villages there



- For when the kodama put an air bubble around the ship: Everyone just stares as the great shark flops helplessly on the deck
