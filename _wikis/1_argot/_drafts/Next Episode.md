Sora and the crew of the Seaward arrive in Osteros. Sora disembarks alone, seeking to add the dragonborn to the heroes' fleet. 

The heroes keep trying to solve the puzzle that they already failed to solve and refuse to kill the triggered trap that would have let them enter the next room quietly. So they enter the next room loudly!

The gang finds themselves in a big ole lava-filled room with a few priests trying to awaken

The sword Sora found on the dead paladin under Aurochs Island, which found its way into Nahk's paws, now is handed off to Livius.

Heroes are headed to Dorost 

The bugbears under Krump (even!) form a warband and take out the rest of the Rakshasas.

The heroes fight the rakshasa warriors until bakasura 

suggestion 

frieza v goku 

kill them all and let god sora them out 

livius forgot that he could cast fly 

kb thought about throwing his sword 

y ou didnt wait for me to drop my weapon 


owie-licious

the bug burier 






BAKASURA ENCOUNTER: 
- mass suggestion: take everything off, gives them rusty swords 
- begin combat: destructive wave, chromatic orb may replace one weapon attack 
- zakya rakshasas will use superiority die every turn 

Gerrik, leader of the bugbears, infected with rage virus



turns out it has started because the bugbears began drinking a sirablood contaminated water source

The rakshasas had started mining and the sirablood leaked in there

give them all what's happening on each of the islands in the next session:

There is a monstrous creature on Dorost that has awakened and it is fiendish

There is a fiendish creature in Nistora

There are fiends and undead on Charatos. There is a disease run rampant on Charatos

Move them along from the arguments, don't let them rehash it 

If Rho decides to leave, have Nausicaa spot Abe and Baltsaros flying toward them, Baltsaros says "You guys kept flying back and forth, we kept losing you, is everything OK?"

drop of pitch containing a devil that is keeping nistora afloat, set there by hespero, slaves also live on the island; devil inside that hates hespero and offers to help

bugbears are infected with a rage virus, can be cured, turns them into undead but they can be brought back and healed

the giants will be in a state of civil war until one side wins (until the heroes choose a side) 

Charatos has a band of bugbears living on it! they are friendly and fun? or maybe they are monstrous; yeah fuck it they're all bad guys

Malory becomes a boss monster, defeats the unspeakable one, not a great way unless he becomes sane 

before giving charon a peach, he would have spent a long time tripping balls in his past lives, absorbing them all

The code is in all her letters (to open her soul box) 

Aramestes must have kept them all and secured it. I don't know how they got scattered to all the islands but a lot can happen in 600 years. I don't know if there are any other letters out there. 

Take me with you to the engine. I have been studying this book. I can turn this off and I can also disable it so the hidimba will never be able to turn it back on.

forgot to mention: serena lets you off, pins it all on paloma

show us the ugliness in the world

- riffrick is a slaver and paloma worked with him
- duchess is not a slaver, read her mind
- duchess never actually attacked them 


Serena is going to be using telekinesis
