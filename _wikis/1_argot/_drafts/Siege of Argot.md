# 0 Introduction
The Siege of Argot is played between 2 factions with 3rd party factions acting separately. The Argot side seeks to eliminate the Mineosi side. The Mineosi side seeks to enter the Old Town sector of the board and hold it.

The game is played in phases: 

1. Initiative: A card is drawn to determine initiative and action points (with 3rd party factions always acting last and always activating all units). 
2. Movement: In initiative order, each side will activate unit groups using their action tokens. Each unit in the group may move up to its full movement, after accounting for terrain restrictions and road bonuses.
3. Combat: Once all factions have moved, battles are fought one at a time. Start with ranged attacks from ranged units, with 1st player followed by 2nd player. Then proceed to battles where 1st player is the attacker and then where the 2nd player is the attacker. 
4. Rally: After all battles are resolved, any Argot units within Argot or adjacent to a supply train may spend resource points to increase their strength. Note that the supply trains must spend resources equal to the steps available. 

# 1 Set Up

## 1.1 Argot Placement

Argot units are placed anywhere on the **pink** city squares, except for the Pontia legions, which must be placed on the road from Pontia (unless the mission "**Kill Hespero and Armand**" is completed, in which case they may be placed within the city); the Nistora units, which can be placed anywhere outside the city; and the friendly Zulon unit (if during "**Parley with Zulon**" Zulon agrees to help) which should be placed outside the city.

Argot supply trains can be placed on any of the supply train starting squares. 

Argot naval units must start in a city dock square or river square.

## 1.2 Mineos Placement

Mineos units start on the road from Kraikos and off the coast of Lighthouse Point.

# 2 Armies
Each block represents a group of fighters. 

## 2.1 Data on Blocks
The symbols on the block indicate movement, initiative, strength, combat rating, and any special abilities. 

### 2.1.1 Strength / Steps

The triangles along the edges of the unit represent the combat strength. This is how many d6 are rolled for a block in combat. Strength is reduced by rotating the block. 

### 2.1.2 Combat Rating and Initiative

The letter and number at the top right of the block represents the initiative and to-hit modifier for the block. Blocks with letter A go before blocks with B, which go before C, which go before D (being the lowest). 

The number indicates the modifier applied to each d6 when rolled by a block. A 6 is a hit. Blocks with +0 modifiers only hit on a 6 while blocks with +1 hit on 5 and 6, +2 hit on 4, 5, and 6. Blocks with +2 modifiers are rare and the modifiers are often conditional. 

### 2.1.3 Movement

The hexagon with the number in the center indicates the number of hexes a unit can move. Blocks may move fewer hexes than this. Terrain will also impact movement. 

### 2.1.4 Cost

The coin with the multiplier indicates how many resources a single strength (step) of a unit will cost to restore. Two steps would cost double that number, and so on. 

### 2.1.5 Special Abilities

Some blocks have special abilities which are placed in the top left or bottom left of the block. 

#### 2.1.5.1 Undead Restoration

Restores 1 strength at the end of the battle.

#### 2.1.5.2 Shock Troops

When the unit is at full strength, its combat rating is +2. 

#### 2.1.5.3 Besieger 

When the unit is attacking a fortification, its combat rating is +1.

#### 2.1.5.4 Berserker

The unit may roll double the amount of dice, if it subsequently reduces its strength by 1.

#### 2.1.5.5 Resilient

Ignores the first hit in a battle.

#### 2.1.5.6 Intimidating 

On the first hit in combat, the enemy must success on a d6+0 morale check versus DC5 or be retreated.

## 2.2 Block Types
Blocks can be ground, sea, and air units. 

### 2.2.1 Ground Units

Ground units may only move via ground squares (rather than sea squares). They may be ferried by sea units, however, but cannot participate in combat.

Ground units must end their movement when entering a hex that is of one of the following types 

- city
- forest
- hill
- ford

or under the following conditions

- disembarking a ship
- entering a hex containing an enemy unit
- entering into a tunnel hex from the corresponding hex (Argot to Undercity and vice versa)

Ground units cannot cross walls or rivers without bridges or fords.

When moving completely along a road, ground units may move an additional hex (+1), as long as that hex is friendly or neutral (not occupied by an enemy unit).

#### 2.2.1.1 Ranged Ground Units

Ground units with the range icon can attack units that many hexes away without being attacked in return. They may also target aerial units. They may not target sea units. Ranged ground units ferried by a naval unit may not attack. 

#### 2.2.1.2 Fortifications

Fortifications are a special type of ground unit and are not represented by a block. They do not move and can only be targeted by units with the besieger special ability. 

Fortifications grant a +1 attack bonus to any defender unit that is on the same hex.

A fortification does not need to be destroyed to be passed through, but when it is destroyed, it no longer grants bonuses to its defenders. 

#### 2.2.1.3 Supply Train

Supply trains are a special type of ground unit. It may move on its own. When it suffers hits and its strength is reduced, its resource value is reduced. The unit may be captured by an enemy.

### 2.2.2 Sea Units 

Sea units can only attack other sea units. They may only travel along sea hexes. 

Sea units can ferry ground units. 

### 2.2.3 Aerial Units

Aerial units may attack any type of unit. They are not hindered by any barriers on the ground or sea and may move across any hex without restriction. They may even move through hexes occupied by enemies, even other aerial units. 

When an aerial unit enters combat, it may only be targeted by aerial units and ranged ground units. 


# 3 Map

The map is separated into two: The main overland map and the Undercity map. 

Half-hexes are playable. Units may be on one or another side of a hex, if there is an impassable boundary through it (like a river or wall--unless it has a gate).

## 3.1 Ground

Ground units may traverse across these hexes. When entering a hex with city, forest, ford, or hills, the unit must end its movement. 

### 3.1.1 City 

Resources may be spent to restore strength points to an Argot or Argot-friendly unit that is in a city hex. It does not need to be on a medical hex to be restored, but the hex must not be contested.

### 3.1.2 Medical

Medical locations indicate places where resources are stored. If the Mineosi faction captures a medical location, it is able to steal 1 resource per turn as long as a unit is present there.

### 3.1.3 Tunnel

Tunnel hexes connect to their complementary Undercity hexes. Ground units end their movement on the other side.

#### 3.1.3.1 The Sanctuary

The Sanctuary is only accessible via a tunnel. It is completely surrounded by walls.

### 3.1.4 Gates

Refer to **2.2.1.2 Fortifications**.

## 3.2 Sea 

Sea squares can only be traversed by sea units. Ground units may be ferried by sea units if they are occupying the same hex.

## 3.3 Road

When all movement occurs along a road, the unit(s) moving may move an extra hex, as long as the hex the unit ends in is neutral or friendly.

# 4 Movement 
During movement, the two sides move their units based on the number of action tokens available, the movement of each unit, and the limitations of the terrain. 

## 4.1 Initiative

Movement order is determined by initiative. A card is drawn from a modified deck of playing cards. If the card is red, Mineos will act first. If the card is black, Argot will act first. The third party neutral units always move last. 

When the deck runs out, a new day begins. The heroes take a long rest. The deck is reshuffled. 

## 4.2 Movement Turn

Each side moves their unit. Side 1 moves all of their units by group, then side 2, and finally, the neutral units move. 

Tokens are used to activate groups of units on a single hex. All of these units may move up to their full movement (calculating road bonuses and terrain restrictions). Ten tokens may be used in a movement turn. 

## 4.3 Terrain

Movement for ground units ends when entering a city, forest, or hill space. Movement by ground units is impeded by rivers and walls. Sea units may only move through sea hexes and along coast hexes. Aerial units are not impeded by any terrain restrictions. 

Roads allow ground units to increase their movement by 1 if all movement is along a road and to ignore city hex restrictions. This is only applicable if the unit does not end their movement in an enemy hex.

## 4.4 Hex Control 

Friendly hexes are occupied by your units. 

Enemy hexes are occupied by enemy units. Blocks end movement in enemy hexes, except aerial units. 

Vacant hexes are occupied by no units and may be moved through.

Blocks entering an occupied hex are the attacker and should be designated as such.

Only 3 units per side may be present in a hex.

## 4.5 Pinning 

When enemy blocks enter your hex, they pin an equal number of blocks. This means that the attacking blocks prevent an equal number of blocks from moving on their turn. The defender decides which blocks are pinned. Unpinned blocks are allowed to move but they must not cross the hexsides through which the enemy blocks entered. 

# 5 Combat

Combat begins once movement is over. 

## 5.1 Battle Sequence

All battles are fought one by one. Battles started by side 1 (where in side 1 is the attacker) are resolved in the order the side determines, followed by side 2, and finally by the third party players. 

## 5.2 Combat Turn

Each block takes as turn in order, starting with the defender's A blocks, followed by the attacker's A blocks, then the defender's B blocks, and so on. Once each block has taken a turn, a round is over. 

### 5.2.1 Combat Round

Battles are fought for a maximum of 3 rounds. By the end of the 3rd round, the side with fewer units in the hex (with the defender winning ties) must retreat.

## 5.3 Combat Resolution

Each block rolls a number of dice equal to its strength and adds its combat modifier to each die rolled. If a value is equal to 6, that counts as a hit. 

Each hit is distributed across the units per the side's preference. Units cannot be targeted. 

## 5.4 Retreating

Units may retreat on their turn. Attacking blocks must retreat over the hexside they entered through. Defending blocks must retreat over a hexside not entered through by an attacking block. 

Retreating blocks must retreat into friendly or neutral hexes. Retreating blocks unable to do this are destroyed. 

Aerial units may retreat across any hexside.

## 5.5 Regrouping

After a battle ends, the victor may regroup. The victor may move any blocks from the victory hex into adjacent friendly or neutral hexes, or add any adjacent blocks to the victory hex. Hexside limits do not apply.

# 6 Rally

## 6.1 Medical Location Raids

If a Mineosi unit begins the rally phase in a Medical Location, the Mineosi side steals 1 resource from the Argot side, which it may immediately use. 

## 6.2 Restoring Strength

Any Argot unit in a city hex may restore its strength according to its strength cost.
