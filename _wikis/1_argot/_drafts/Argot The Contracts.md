## The City Assembly

**At Sea**: It takes a few days for the heroes to get back home. Hespero leaves them and leaves it up to them to figure out how to get back in. He tells them that there is a pretty tough blockade but they can avoid it. He also tells them that they are strong enough to take on the Deathless One. Barty suggests they run the blockade since they are at least able to fly. The rest of the ships join the heroes along the way. The Duchess also hovers overhead. 

**Running the Blockade**: Barty runs the blockade to get the heroes back home. The ship flies over the Mineosi ships below. They are sunk and routed. The Duchess's ships appear in the sky, assisting in the blockade run. The Duchess meets Hespero.

**Triumphant Return**: Leandro greets Sora and the others at the docks. 

**CASINO HEIST**: Pamphlets litter the streets, complaining that the city's elite still go to the casino while the city starves and loses its youth the machine of war. The heroes may determine that the best way to pay off the city's debts is by robbing Hespero's casino. 

There are posters plastered advertising the Temple of Oret, Hespero's new casino. Some are defaced.

**Meeting the Triumvirs**: Armand insists that the group meets in the Assembly Hall. Hespero calls in via magic mirror (and was against meeting in this way). 
- "Why do you keep calling it the 40 day campaign ? It’s not like a unified campaign that anyone did on purpose. We weren’t all waiting for 40 days for you all to come back."
- Hespero suggests to Leandro that he offer the heroes jobs as a Special Forces unit, with a salary of 20 gp per day. "If they were able to make their way out of the demiplane, they are worth the money."
   - report to triumvirs, specifically Leandro
   - commission: a year
   - 20 gp a day
   - citizenry of Argot and a plot of land
- Barty asks for his admiralty to be legitimized and for their 13 Islands Fleet to be commissioned. 
- Issuing of contracts
   - **COUNTERINTELLIGENCE**
   - **UNDERMINE CALANTHA**
   - **DISRUPT MINEOSI OPERATIONS**
   - **PARLEY WITH ZULON**
- The Triumvirs ask for input on how to spend the 30 resources currently available to the city. Resources will be used during the war to heal units (not to feed the city). 
   - **TRAIN TROOPS**
   - **FORTIFY DEFENSES**
   - **DEFEND SUPPLY LINES**

**Riot outside the Assembly Hall**: Waiting outside the assembly hall, Kaolina has been excluded. Calantha and her shadow government have suggested that they capitulate to the Mineosi. A riot begins outside the Assembly Hall. The triumvirs request that the heroes defend them from the rioters. 

**Mallory imprisoned**: As the heroes guide the triumvirs out through the undercity, they see Mallory in a cell. "I was arrested for picking an orange from an orange grove. Apparently it was Hespero's orange grove. But Lori is coming to rescue me, so don't worry about it. Though that might have been a dream. Anyway, Charon is waiting for me and I need to get him an orange. Can I entice you with this diamond maybe?" "I finally figured everything out. You don't understand. Let me out. I'll take you to the great secret I've found."  Mallory discusses wanting to travel to another plane again since he wants to destroy the true Unspeakable One. The Gang of Four recall that they do know one interdimensional traveler: Pinot Merlot, the mind-flayer, and his flumph paralegals, and that you also have his business card and contact information. **FREE MALLORY**

**The Contracts:** All of the contracts are provided. 

## The Dinner Party (Same Night)
You enter the villa and the clues are all there. The three headed mosaic featuring a panther leopard tiger 
- Ralos (Ralos is explicitly served lobster).
- Armand
- Hespero
- the Bakasura
- the Duchess Serena
- Leandro
- Calantha
- Nestor
- Ambassador Kaolina
- Odoacer
- the rest of the surviving Ten Generals
- all of the City Council are present

Dinner is served. Greek salad , lobsters, skirt steaks, and risotto. The chef emerges , and he is a refugee from telens that hespero met 

**Nahk's blade**: Krump approaches Nahk at the fountain. 

Nahk is sent into Whispered Conversations. "Someone's spying on us," Hespero says and points to the glaive. "Ah it is just the ghosts in the Binder of the Dead." 

The Bakasura: "Ah you found the Binder of the Dead. It served me well." **EXORCISE THE BINDER OF THE DEAD**

**Ralos and Sora confer**: Ralos takes Sora aside into Whispered Conversations. **KILL HESPERO AND ARMAND**. "What, you're going to kill this Deathless One and turn around and kill Hespero and his goons right after? Don't be absurd, Sora. He's going to take that time to solidify his power. Without Armand and Hespero, Leandro will be forced to let in our legions and for Werriad to take command of the city. This is the right moment. Here." He presents you with an earring that casts mind blank. "I have some for your friends as well, but I will not pass them out just yet, though I recommend you hand them out before you let them in on this." 

**Livius takes Hobbes aside:** But JK it's Hespero: He is angry with Hobbes: "Did you think I would forget what you owed me? I have a way for you to pay me back." **KILL THE BARGAINER**

**Return of the Bakasura**: The Bakasura arrives with his rakshasa soldiers. The Bakasura kisses Hespero's rings and Hespero says you may have met before, but this time you shall be allies. The Bakasura says that it is all under the bridge but he eyes Nahk. 

**Negotiation with the Duchess**: The duchess would come to the heroes' aid and tell the people that they liberated the demiplane (as a way to convince them to join them against the Mineosi). She tells them that she wants compensation. **KILL THE DUCHESS**
   - Discuss how the Duchess's alliance will be determined.
   - The Duchess asks if the heroes require the air fleets or ground troops or both?
   - The Duchess is curious about the Mineosi Empire but realizes with the stories that she has heard that her army cannot overtake Argot or Mineos on her own and she does not scheme further to undermine the heroes. She is true to her word and will tend her garden after the siege. 

**Tales from the Demiplane**: The heroes are encouraged to speak of the demiplane and what happened there. The others allude to the Hidimba, the mythological creature and ask about him. (No one but the heroes know that Hespero is he, aside from the Bakasura of course).

**Theo approaches**: He is a servant and approaches the heroes. "You are comfortable in the lap of the tiger I see." If the heroes bite and say that they want to destroy Hespero, he will let them know that there is a weapon in the Godsbody that can destroy Hespero. **THE LIMINAL ARROW**

**Assembling the People of the 13 Islands**: The heroes can contemplate about who to ask for help from the 13 Islands, knowing they will probably say yes. 

**The Kodama's vengeance**: 

**Skyswimmer**: The heroes could ride the skyswimmer during the siege and do fights on it.

God ichor seems to be attracted to sirablood; anything that has sirablood in it feels a slight tug toward the ichor.

# The Eve of Battle
The heroes sit around a campfire.
1. Name 1 desire
2. Name 1 fear

# After the Battle
After the battle, roll 2d6. This determines the outcome of your desire and fear. 

Mallory appears out of nowhere and tells the heroes that his research has pointed him to the wastes of the East where great monsters live, once a generation leveling entire towns and villages. 

> nah it just doesnt seem like the deathless one is actually important enough to be invited. i feel like that is part of his deal: he has all these hang-ups about immortality and being a living god that him being invited would give him too much validation

# Contracts

Each mission that requires skill checks requires 3 successes in a row. The hero may take 20 but this takes up 3 days (though it still equals 1 success). For example a hero may take 20 for all 3 skill checks, resulting in 9 total days. The DC is set to 15.
