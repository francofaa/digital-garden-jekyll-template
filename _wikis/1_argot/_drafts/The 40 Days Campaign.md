Hespero is summoned once more, and he brings with him scrolls upon scrolls. "I believe these names may sound familiar: Phillip, Geth, Sumara. I could go on. You owed all these people money. Well. You used to. Now you owe _me_, and I am here to collect. Unless we can come to a different arrangement."

### Commander Encounters
```ad-warning
title: Introducing Calis, Commander of the Navies
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The ships of the Mineosi navy are conventional: massive triremes with artillery, longships ready for quick landings. The flagship however is another monster entirely. Wreathed in seaweed and glowing an eerie blue, the lead ship of this navy is commanded by a woman upon a throne. She is ten feet in height, and her throne is made of petrified corpses. Rather than legs, she has a long snake body that is as green as she is. She shades her eyes a golden helm. Her hair is like a nest of vipers. By the end of the battle, several of your people have become statues and sink to the bottom of the sea with so many others, not likely to be seen for thousands of years. The Argoti general reports back with this strange tale and warns of Calis and word spreads of her deadly stare.

```

```ad-warning
title: Introducing Helios and his mount Cloudstride, cavalary commander
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The yellow-wreathed Mineosi infantry are joined by a cavalry of strange beasts and their riders. Leading the charge is a man in white shining armor, his white hair catching the breeze, and he rides a white saber-toothed lion with massive wings. Foot soldiers struck by his magical bolts are unable to recover, resistant to any potions or conventional medicine, as their flesh deteriorates. Others merely turn to ash as they get near. Those who survive speak of his lion, Cloudstride, devouring the dead on the field. Helios is the rider's name and his magic burns like the sun. 

```

```ad-warning
title: Introducing Syrax, sky commander, naval battle
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The sailors point to the sky as they clash with the Mineosi navy. At first it seems to be a flock of ravens, but the birds grow larger as it becomes clear that these are monsters. They are clad in gold and black, their wings like bat wings. They swoop down and drop sailors into the sea, but they do not hunger for flesh: It is treasure they seek. Their leader, the fiend Syrax leaves a crew alive to deliver a message to the Argoti leadership: "You spend the blood of your people without a second thought. It is not what they want. So we shall strike where it truly hurts: your coffers."
```

```ad-warning
title: Introducing Iron Reaper, Infantry commander
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The undead are among the warriors here, but it is no surprise. Ravenous ghouls are led by aristocratic vampires on black steeds, alongside regular humanoid infantry. The Argoti soldiers were warned as much. But they were not forewarned for what they saw on the field that day: Living metal, creatures made of forged steel and moving parts. The largest of them, a brute made of blades who cut the poor youths of Argot to ribbons and set them ablaze with bolts of fire. But it was not just a brute. The officers that day heard it shouting commands, its automatons snapping to attention and moving in unison. The Iron Reaper they called him, for they knew no of no other name.
```
## Diplomacy
```ad-failure
title: Spymaster Hezran has intercepted your diplomatic mission
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The city's rulers send a message back to you: The head of the ambassador along with a note that reads, "Hezran sends his regards." Through back channels and research, Hespero learns that Hezran is the name of the Mineosi spymaster. He narrows his eyes at the doppelganger who hands him this information.
```

```ad-failure
title: Attempts to negotiate with Zulon
collapse: closed

The ambassador manages to find Zulon in a settlement ravaged by war and carnage. Devils abound. They torture and eat humanoids and as the ambassador steps forward, the devils all eye him curiously and muttering in tongues. The hulking mass of Zulon appears, his tiny withered wings on his back, almost comical, were it not for the rows of jagged shark teeth in his mouth. "You have come to be judged?" The ambassador, in his fear, trembles. A trial begins as massive bone devils seize the ambassador by the arms, and his bodyguards who try to stop them are skewered by them and die slowly. The ambassador's fate is unknown, for this message was relayed by a page in the ambassador's retinue who managed to escape into the trees.

```

```ad-failure
title: Failure
collapse: closed

The council/king/queen/archons dismiss the ambassador and make no promises about remaining neutral. The ambassador passes a yellow-robed Mineosi ambassador on the way out.

```

```ad-success
title: Success
collapse: closed

## Tokens
### Oret's Tokens
```ad-success
title: Using an Oret's blessing token
collapse: closed

- [ ] The birds overhead obscure the sun for a moment, flying in a strange pattern. The enemies are blinded for long enough for the Argoti to send them back into a rout.
- [ ] The dying embers of the cookfires crack the remaining coal in jagged lines. Sudden flames spring up behind enemy lines. The Mineosi make a messy retreat.
- [ ] A melody catches on the breeze, from a distant windchime beyond time and space. The Mineosi are deafened. Finding it difficult to communicate with their commanders and in their sudden confusion, the Argoti begin pushing them back and eventually turn the tide of the battle.
```

### Hespero Tokens
```ad-success
title: Using a Hespero influence token
collapse: closed

- [x]  The ambassador and the king go back and forth, with the king unable to commit to either situation. He keeps putting the ambassador off, telling him to wait. The ambassador writes to Hespero as he was instructed to. As soon as he finished the note, Hespero appears in a sudden puff of black smoke. He storms into the throne room dashes to the king, sizing him up. Hespero points his finger at the ground, magically scorching a circle as he walks around the king. "Have an answer for me before you step out of that circle." Fearing for his life, the king relents and accepts the alliance.
- [ ] Hespero is summoned once more, carrying a bag of holding with a variety of riches, one more extravagant than the next. He sets them each on a table. The king salivates over the assortment of treasures and tells the Argoti ambassador to shove off. "You heard him," Hespero said, "leave the adults alone to talk."
- [x]  Hespero is summoned once more, and he brings with him scrolls upon scrolls. "I believe these names may sound familiar: Phillip, Geth, Sumara. I could go on. You owed all these people money. Well. You used to. Now you owe _me_, and I am here to collect. Unless we can come to a different arrangement."
```
### Werriadi Tokens
```ad-important
title: Werriadi Aid
collapse: closed

- [x] "We are happy to come to your aid. Mineos is a bully and a threat to our way of life." The city councilors at the round table applaud as Kaolina rises and bows to leave. Calantha and her cronies chatter in the corner and wonder loudly what this aid, given freely, will cost them one day. Leandro, the only office-holder of your triumvirate, stares her down and says, "We can't afford not to take this aid."
- [x] "It is to the mutual benefit of our two nations that we continue to work together. I am happy to sign off on this aid." Kaolina smiles and rises, waiting for applause that does not come. The councilors all quietly thank her. Leandro shakes her hand at the door while Calantha whispers into General Odoacer's ear.
- [ ] Kaolina does not sit. From the door, she hands one of the city councilors the signed agreement for aid. "The Werriadi Republic takes a great interest in protecting your city-state against Mineosi encroachment." She thanks the councilor and leaves. Leandro watches as a pair of Werriadi legionaries escort her back to the embassy. Calantha steps over to Leandro and says, loud enough for the rest of the council to hear, "You let in one empire while fighting off another." Leandro has nothing to say, recalling his deal with Sora. Calantha's words sting as he wonders whether there was another way, an Argolosi way, to solve this, and prays to all the gods that he hasn't just surrendered his own country in order to save it.

## Home Front Consequences

```

```ad-danger
title: famine
collapse: closed

- [ ]  With the collapse of the regional trade and supply chain, there are food and water shortages. The harvest on Argolos has begun to be rationed and bread lines spring up as Hespero tries his best to feed to populace with his private reserves. It is difficult, however, since it is not a problem of funds but a problem of access.

```

```ad-danger
title: anxiety
collapse: closed

- [ ]  People are anxious about the war, suspicious of their neighbors. People start hoarding what little food and supplies there are, leaving nothing for the poorest of the city. People stop trusting each other, only coming out on market day.

```

```ad-danger
title: unrest
collapse: closed

- [ ]  Hespero's partisans underground start getting attacked by the Bargainer's partisans. The Bargainer, a vampire lord who lives in the Undercity, has seen this opportunity to take over the Undercity from the rakshasa. Meanwhile aboveground, Calantha's gang has begun clashing with Armand's partisans as well, looting shops owned by friends of Armand and Hespero, and starting a protection racket. 

```


```ad-danger
title: challengers
collapse: closed

- [ ]  Treasurer Calantha Aran declares that the war has become too costly and distributes pamphlets to that effect. Meanwhile Odoacer, Leandro's rival general, privately confides with city councilors that he could be running the war better. Nestor Domorosi, city attorney who sympathized with the Mineosi, begins griping to anyone who will listen that the Mineosi invasion is the result of a personal squabble.

```

```ad-danger
title: reprisals
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The people of the Undercity, long maligned and blamed for problems, have begun emerging during the night. Attacks begin, merrows, duergar, doppelgangers, and goblins start murdering and robbing citizens. Though Hespero tries to stop the attacks and his partisans assure him they have nothing to do with them, the attacks continue. 

```

```ad-danger
title: desertions
collapse: closed

- [ ]  Covered wagons start springing up at the edge of town as people begin to leave en masse. Fights start in the street, with deserters being called cowards.

```

```ad-danger
title: desperation
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The collapse of the regional supply chain has made people desperate. They start stealing from each other and openly fighting in the streets. On market day this week, seven people were trampled by a crowd fighting over the last turnip.

```

```ad-danger
title: idleness
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The anxiety of the war has gotten to people. Several citizens begin skipping work, drinking, gambling, fighting. People start settling scores, with violence, leading to sporadic of revenge killing cycles, and people start making new scores: taking on debts, getting into new fights. 

```


```ad-danger
title: judgment
collapse: closed

- [ ]  At every city council meeting, Leandro, Armand, and Hespero's doppelganger are barraged with questions by their rivals and now their allies. They are regularly harassed in the streets without reprecussions, as even their city-appointed bodyguards give them the side eye. They rely more on private protection now.

```

```ad-danger
title: obligation
collapse: closed

- [ ]  The surrounding villages on Argolos have become more demanding, and meanwhile the Werriadi have requested more overtures of devotion: parades, exhibitions of Werriadi art, distribution of pamphlets. 

```

```ad-danger
title: strangers
collapse: closed

- [ ]  Stretched as the Argoti resources have been at the front, fewer city patrol are able to track the comings and goings of the people in town. Even Hespero's partisans in the Undercity are losing track. The crowds have become more diverse, and people have reported suspicious behavior, but without any hard proof.
