title: Fortifications

Each 2 centimeter wall of Argot has its own stat block. It grants a +2 AC and +2 Morale to any [[Units and Stacks]] defending the wall. Once a 2 centimeter section of wall is destroyed, it is considered breached and may be moved freely through it by [[Ground Units]]. 

[[Aerial Units]] can fly over fortifications.

Additional fortifications can be built on the map to represent traps, barriers, ditches, and so on.
