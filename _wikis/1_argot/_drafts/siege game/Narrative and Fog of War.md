title: Narrative and Fog of War
---
To maintain a believable fog of war element, please stay on the opposite side of the map so as not to see the other side of the [[Units and Stacks]]. However, this is still a narrative game and I am a dungeon master, not your opponent, so if you see something by accident, that's fine. 

Any information you would be able to glean from my side will be described to you for free; however, as in a standard combat encounter, you would not know the capabilities and stats of the enemy units.
