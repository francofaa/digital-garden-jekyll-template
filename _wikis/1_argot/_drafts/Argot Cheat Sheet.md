# What is this game?
This is a war game of the Siege of Argot. The turns take place over the span of a few minutes. 

# What am I trying to do?

- Stop Mineos from reaching the Sanctuary.
- Kill the Deathless One.
- Kill the Deathless One's generals.

# How do we start?

## Initiative
Start with initiative: A single card is drawn to determine Player 1 for the round: 

- Black for Argot
- Red for Mineos

When the cards are expended, a **day** has passed and **the heroes take a long rest.** Reshuffle and start a new day.

## Movement
Player 1 does all their movement, followed by Player 2. Then the neutral factions go (controlled by the DM). A neutral black block facing you means that it is controlled by Argot. 

### What gets to move?
Put an action token on the group of units (on a single hex) that you want to activate. You have 10 of these. The units can split up and everything, but they have to be activated. Mainly to keep track of what's moved.

### How do they move?

All units move a number of spaces indicated in the hex in the corner of their block.

- **Sea Units**: Water hexes only. They can ferry troops as well. They end their movement in an enemy hex
- **Aerial Units**: Any space! They are unhindered by barriers and hex type. They can even move through enemy hexes. They can only be targeted by ranged attacks or other aerial units but they can attack any unit.
- **Ground Units**: 
   - They can be ferried (but they cannot fight if they are engaged)
   - They end movement in hexes with the following terrain or conditions
      - city
      - forest
      - ford
      - hill
      - crossing into a tunnel hex onto the other map
      - next hex after a ford (representing river crossing)
      - enemy hex
  - They get +1 to movement if all movement is along a road (and ignore any terrain penalty, like city)

# How do we fight?
After movement is over, combat starts with every contested hex where Player 1 is the attacking player. 

Blocks attack thrice, in alphabetical order (defender winning ties). The side with the most blocks in a hex (defender winning ties) forces the enemy to retreat.

## What's a hit? 
Roll 1d6 per strength point and add the combat bonus to each d6: Every 6 is a hit. The defender decides how to distribute the hits.

## How does retreating work? 
Your unit can retreat on its turn or be retreated if it loses a fight. If it is an attacker, it must leave via a hexside that was crossed by an attacker. If it is a defender, it can leave except via a hexside that was crossed by an attacker. 

## What happens when I win a fight? 
The enemy retreats and the victor gets to spread out, if they choose to: They may move any units from the victory hex to an adjacent non-enemy hex or bring in units from adjacent hexes into the victory hex. 

# What are the symbols in the top left corner of the blocks? 
Some blocks have special abilities. 

- **Nistora Raiders, Hespero's Rakshasas:** Resilient: Ignores the first hit in combat. 
- **Any Zulon unit:** Intimidating: On the first hit in combat, the enemy must success on a d6+0 morale check versus DC5 or be retreated.
- **Charatos Bugbears:** Berserker: At the cost of 1 strength, the unit may roll double the amount of dice. 

## Any other special combat rules? 

Up to five Argot units have **range**: A unit may hit a target from a range equal to the number next to the target icon. This is triggered during combat phase. 

- Hama Slingers (range 2)
- 2 sets of Argot Rangers (range 2)
- 2 sets of Nistora Raiders (range 1)

Also, **Fortifications** grant a +1 attack bonus to any *defender* unit that is on the same hex.

Fortifications have their own strength points, which can be reduced only by siege units.


# We're done fighting. Now what?
Keep an eye on those **medical** hexes. Mineos will steal your resources.

You can choose to **rally**: Argot units **inside** of Argot (any city hex counts as Argot) may spend resource points from the resources bank to restore strength. 

Units **adjacent to a supply train** may also take resources from a supply train, but they must spend a number equal to a full step down. 

Then draw initiative!
