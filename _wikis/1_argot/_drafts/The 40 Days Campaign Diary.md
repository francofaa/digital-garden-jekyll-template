# Phase 1: Early Victories (Day 1-13)

## The Battle of Aurochs Island

The first engagement **Battle of Aurochs Island** is won by the Argoti as they relieve the people of Aurochs Island from the Mineosi encroachment. [[The Deathless One]] departs after PS Admirable Effort is disappeared. [[Leandro Damaskenos]], now no longer facing the terrifying presence of the Deathless One, is able to fend off the Mineosi contingent that has arrived. He rushes back to Argot to confer with [[Hespero]] and [[Armand Colodrise]] to determine how to best wage this war. 

## The Battles in the Golden Gulf

On the third day, Argoti and Mineosi forces skirmish off the coast of Kalens. More and more diplomats are sent off to plead the case of the Argoti. It's only on day five when Hespero's infernal aid is called to convince the King of Grypsera to side with them. 

> The ambassador and the king go back and forth, with the king unable to commit to either side. He keeps putting the ambassador off, telling him to wait. The ambassador writes to Hespero as he was instructed to. As soon as he finishes the note, Hespero appears in a sudden puff of black smoke. He storms into the throne room, dashes to the king, sizing him up. Hespero points his finger at the ground, magically scorching a circle as he walks around the king. "Have an answer for me before you step out of that circle." Fearing for his life, the king relents and accepts the alliance.

A slew of early victories in the first week along the Golden Coast convince the cities to side with the Argoti. **The Battles in the Golden Gulf** are at a stalemate.

## The First Siege of Sidicea

The **First Siege of Sidicea** leaves the city firmly in Argoti hands and effectively ends the stalemate in the Golden Gulf. 

The dying embers of the cookfires crack the remaining coal in jagged lines. Sudden flames spring up behind enemy lines. The Mineosi make a messy retreat from the Golden Gulf. The Argoti are able to land boots onto the Golden Coast. Someone hits the jackpot at Hespero's new casino.

By the end of the second week, all of the Known World is on Argot's side against the encroaching Empire as the mountainous Gomotesc promises troops to their aid. However, the coalition forces' resources are becoming strained and more loans are taken on at unfavorable rates.


# Phase 2: Strained Resources, Strained Allies, and More Miracles (Day 14-20)
## Home Front
> While trying to negotiate for more funds at the Minderico Bank, the Treasury clerk of Argot summons Hespero. He brings with him scrolls upon scrolls. "I believe these names may sound familiar: Phillip, Geth, Sumara. I could go on. You owed all these people money. Well. You used to. Now you owe _me_, and I am here to collect. Unless we can come to a different arrangement."

Eager to enrich the war coffers and high off the early victories and alliances, Leandro contacts [[Kaolina Serrat]]:

> "We are happy to come to your aid. Mineos is a bully and a threat to our way of life." The city councilors at the round table applaud as Kaolina rises and bows to leave. [[Calantha Aran]] and her cronies chatter in the corner and wonder loudly what this aid, given freely, will cost them one day. Leandro, the only office-holder of your triumvirate, stares her down and says, "We can't afford not to take this aid."

All the four seas are calm as Mineos licks their wounds. On the Sunrise Sea, the people of Telens watch as golden sails appear on the horizon. 

## The Iron Wall

Meanwhile, a new naval commander appears in the Great Sea as well:

> The ships of the Mineosi navy are conventional: massive triremes with artillery, longships ready for quick landings. The flagship however is another monster entirely. Wreathed in seaweed and glowing an eerie blue, the lead ship of this navy is commanded by a woman upon a throne. She is ten feet in height, and her throne is made of petrified corpses. Rather than legs, she has a long snake body that is as green as she is. She shades her eyes with a golden helm. Her hair is like a nest of vipers. By the end of the battle, several of your people have become statues and sink to the bottom of the sea with so many others, not likely to be seen for thousands of years. The Argoti general reports back with this strange tale and warns of [[Calis]] and word spreads of her deadly stare.

Knowing [[Odoacer]]'s desire to one-up him, Leandro tasks the general with the defense of the Sickle Island and the southern front. Odoacer's natural reluctance to battle leads to the Argoti strategy of the **Iron Wall**, a naval defense against Calis's attempts to get nearer to the Argolosi home island. Calis's fleets break themselves against the Iron Wall and the Sickle Island navies under Odoacer's command goes on the offensive, pushing the enemy into the Great Sea.

## The Battle of the Great Sea
Eventually, the navies of the Sickle Island continue pushing ahead, culminating in the Mineosi defeat in the **Battle of the Great Sea**. However, they do not attempt a landing in Adugari or Zagari. The birds overhead obscure the sun for a moment, flying in a strange pattern. The enemies are blinded for long enough for the Argoti to send them back into a rout. Someone hits the jackpot at Hespero's new casino. Calis and her fleets limp back to Zagari to raise more navies. 

High off his victory, Odoacer returns home in triumph, sending General [[Simon]] in his stead to lead the defense of the Sickle Islands.

## The Siege of Kalens

The people of Kalens are desperate as the **Siege of Kalens** brews on the horizon from encroaching foot soldiers. It ends up being the longest engagement of the 40 Day Campaign. 

The coalition forces at Sidicea begin seizing resources from the locals under the direction of General [[Cosmo]], one of Leandro's military allies who has been dispatched to oversee the Golden League operations. He will never see Argot again. The Sidicean soldiers under Commander [[Zosimo]] follow the orders with zeal.

## The First Siege of Telens

The people of Telens suffer for days during the **First Siege of Telens** as the Sunrise Fleet of Mineos batter the walls and harbor. The gate into the Golden Gulf is under threat. A slapdash naval force raised by the [[Archons of Telens]] is unable to fend them off. Countryside levees are raised for the defense of the city. 

The people of Sidicea have had enough of the raids and resist the coalition forces stationed there even as the Mineosi loom. The people suffer as Cosmo sends word back home that they've just been "foraging". 

As the situations at Sidicea and Kalens grow dire, Leandro turns to Kaolina once more: 

> "It is to the mutual benefit of our two nations that we continue to work together. I am happy to sign off on this aid." Kaolina smiles and rises, waiting for applause that does not come. The councilors all quietly thank her. Leandro shakes her hand at the door while Calantha whispers into General [[Odoacer]]'s ear.

But then on day 20, two miracles occur: Telens and Kalens are able to defeat the Mineosi troops, though the skirmishes near Kalens do not fully break the siege, but offer some relief and hope. A melody catches on the breeze, from a distant windchime beyond time and space. The Mineosi outside of Telens are deafened. Finding it difficult to communicate with their commanders and in their sudden confusion, the Argoti begin pushing them back and eventually turn the tide of the battle. Someone hits the jackpot at Hespero's new casino.

## Home Front

But even as word of this victory begins making its slow way home, the home front starts to deteriorate: 

> Treasurer Calantha Aran declares that the war has become too costly and distributes pamphlets to that effect. Meanwhile Odoacer, Leandro's rival general, privately confides with city councilors that he could be running the war better. [[Nestor Domorosi]], city attorney who sympathized with the Mineosi, begins griping to anyone who will listen that the Mineosi invasion is the result of a personal squabble.

> Hespero's partisans underground start getting attacked by the Bargainer's partisans. The Bargainer, a vampire lord who lives in the Undercity, has seen this opportunity to take over the Undercity from the rakshasa. Meanwhile aboveground, Calantha's gang has begun clashing with Armand's partisans as well, looting shops owned by friends of Armand and Hespero, and starting a protection racket.
   
> Covered wagons start springing up at the edge of town as people begin to leave en masse. Fights start in the street, with deserters being called cowards.

# Phase 3: Desperation and Pillaging (Day 21-30)
Needless raids into the Sidicea hinterlands cause massive unrest. The city council begins tightening the budget and demobilizing armies to cut cost. The army has resorted to eating their shoes. 

## The Siege of Kalens (continued)
The people of the Kalens countryside suffer from the army's requisitioning of resources. Commander [[Jason]], a young officer of Kalens, is the oldest officer left after disastrous sorties against the Mineosi. General Simon in the Sickle Islands continues skirmishes in the Great Sea to fend off even more trouble, but the people of Kalens are still in peril from the encroaching Mineosi infantries.

Great Sickle, long neglected by the coalition forces, has been infiltrated by the Mineosi under Calis's command on day 23. They hold onto it with little resistance but General Simon begins mobilizing Sickle Island navies to liberate their ally. 

Fleets from Zagari and Adugari are raised to support the Siege of Kalens. 

## The Battle of Podana Pass

The Mineosi break through during the **Battle of the Podana Pass** and get closer to Sidicea. Cosmo and Zosimo are able to escape with their lives, but their troops are demoralized.

> The yellow-wreathed Mineosi infantry are joined by a cavalry of strange beasts and their riders. Leading the charge is a man in white shining armor, his white hair catching the breeze, and he rides a white saber-toothed lion with massive wings. Foot soldiers struck by his magical bolts are unable to recover, resistant to any potions or conventional medicine, as their flesh deteriorates. Others merely turn to ash as they get near. Those who survive speak of his lion, [[Cloudstride]], devouring the dead on the field. [[Helios]] is the rider's name and his magic burns like the sun.

As Calantha continues to tighten the pursestrings of the treasury, Leandro convinces the council to once again take aid from the Werriadi. 

> Kaolina does not sit. From the door, she hands one of the city councilors the signed agreement for aid. "The Werriadi Republic takes a great interest in protecting your city-state against Mineosi encroachment." She thanks the councilor and leaves. Leandro watches as a pair of Werriadi legionaries escort her back to the embassy. Calantha steps over to Leandro and says, loud enough for the rest of the council to hear, "You let in one empire while fighting off another." Leandro has nothing to say, recalling his deal with Sora. Calantha's words sting as he wonders whether there was another way, an Argolosi way, to solve this, and prays to all the gods that he hasn't just surrendered his own country in order to save it.

## The Siege of Kalens (continued)

Kalens continues to stave off attacks from both land and sea, but the coalition army resorts to raiding the city stores as the siege becomes dire, entering its eighth day. 

> The undead are among the warriors here, but it is no surprise. Ravenous ghouls are led by aristocratic vampires on black steeds, alongside regular humanoid infantry. The Argoti and coalition soldiers were warned as much. But they were not forewarned for what they saw on the field that day: Living metal, creatures made of forged steel and moving parts. The largest of them, a brute made of blades who cut the poor youths to ribbons and set them ablaze with bolts of fire. But it was not just a brute. The officers that day heard it shouting commands, its automatons snapping to attention and moving in unison. [[The Iron Reaper]] they called him, for they knew no of no other name.

## The Second Siege of Telens

Another small naval force from Podana begins the **Second Siege of Telens**, which lasts all of a few days, and the city falls to the Mineosi on the 26th day. But King [[Radu]] of Grypsera and Commander Zosimo and the city council of Sidicea raise levees to free the city, on Leandro's command. Yet more soldiers are recruited from the Sidicea hinterlands to defend the city as the Podana armies under Helios march forward. 

## Operation Great Reaping

Starting into the fifth week (day 29), Odoacer relays to General Simon to initiate **Operation Great Reaping**. The combat begins with an amphibious landing on Great Sickle to liberate the island from Calis.

## Home Front

The people of Grypsera are called upon again to give up their grain and food to the coalition's cause. By the end of 30 days, the situation back in Argot deteriorates once more. 

> Disease runs rampant as the regional trade grinds to a halt. Without medicine, people become desperate and are dying in the streets.

> The people of the Undercity, long maligned and blamed for problems, have begun emerging during the night. Attacks begin, merrows, duergar, doppelgangers, and goblins start murdering and robbing citizens. Though Hespero tries to stop the attacks and his partisans assure him they have nothing to do with them, the attacks continue.

> Stretched as the Argoti resources have been at the front, fewer city patrol are able to track the comings and goings of the people in town. Even Hespero's partisans in the Undercity are losing track. The crowds have become more diverse, and people have reported suspicious behavior, but without any hard proof.

The Treasurer's clerk summons Hespero once more to negotiate a deal with a banker.

> Hespero enters carrying a bag of holding with a variety of riches, as collateral, one more extravagant than the next. He sets them each on a table. The banker nods appraisingly over the assortment of treasures and tells the clerk to shove off. "You heard him," Hespero said, "leave the adults alone to talk."

# Phase 4: The Fall of Kalens and the Arrival of Zulon (Day 31-36)
## The Siege of Kalens (continued)
The coalition army outside Kalens falls to the Mineosi troops. The people of Kalens raise a citizen militia, but they are driven out, ending the Siege of Kalens. Commander Jason and his remaining soldiers begin attacking from the mountains, but their guerilla campaign is short-lived as the Iron Reaper's automatons systematically hunt them down. The young commander is killed with his soldiers as they waited for help from General Simon on Great Sickle. The city-state of Kalens is absorbed into the Mineosi Empire, ending the longest battle in the campaign so far.

## The Battle of the Niahal Coast

Argoti navies under General [[Theron]], an ally of Leandro, sent to support the recapture of Telens, intercept a fleet of Mineosi trying to attack Niahal, which has long been a stronghold of the coalition. After three days of darting in and out among each other and by the end of week five, the Mineosi attack on Niahal fails as the ships are routed and sent to the bottom of the sea in the **Battle of the Niahal Coast**.

## The Battle of Telens Underbridge

On day 34, the skirmishing and battles in Telens and on the seas surrounding it turn in Argot's favor as another of Odoacer's allies delivers a victory for the coalition. The **Battle of Telens Underbridge** turns in Argot's favor, and the Mineosi abandon the city by sea as the coalition ships dock in the harbor and troops from Sidicea and Grypsera kill the remaining Mineosi marine forces.

## The Battle of the Foothills
On the same day, however, the Argoti home guard under General [[Beren]], an ally of Leandro, makes a shocking discovery after reports from Varak are substantiated: An infernal army led by a unholy creature named Zulon has arrived. They parade around the countryside and little effort is made to communicate with them. However on day 37, the army engages with them in the **Battle of the Foothills** and the creatures slip into the darkness, luring the troops deeper and deeper into the foothills. The home guard disappears, and shepherds find their cookfires still warm. 

## Operation Great Reaping (continued)
Operation Great Reaping is a failure as the navies flee in a rout on day 36. General Simon escapes to return to Argot in shame, just on the heels of the news of Kalens and his failure to lift that siege as well. Calis, commander of the Mineosi navy, sends word to the Deathless One to journey to Great Sickle to begin preparations for taking over the rest of the Sickle Islands.

# Phase 5: The Retreat to Argolos (Days 37-40)
## The Capitulation of Telens
Telens falls on day 38 in the **Capitulation of Telens** as a massive fleet from the other side of the Sunrise Sea arrives, having picked up Podana troops along the way. 

> The sailors point to the sky as they clash with the Mineosi navy. At first it seems to be a flock of ravens, but the birds grow larger as it becomes clear that these are monsters. They are clad in gold and black, their wings like bat wings. They swoop down and drop sailors into the sea, but they do not hunger for flesh: It is treasure they seek. Their leader, the fiend [[Syrax]] leaves a crew alive to deliver a message to the Argoti leadership: "You spend the blood of your people without a second thought. It is not what they want. So we shall strike where it truly hurts: your coffers." The city of Telens, bereft of resources and desperate for stability, capitulates.

Clearly outnumbered, the skeleton force that survived the Battle of Telens Underbridge departs, the last of the ships fleeing by day 40, leaving no coalition navies in the Golden Gulf. General Theron is killed in the combat, his junior officers leading the retreat to Argot. News of his death arrives with the return of the Damage Sluts.

## The Second Siege of Sidicea

The city council of Sidicea, long languishing under the raids and pillaging of the coalition forces, betrays Commander Zosimo and General Cosmo to Helios in the **Second Siege of Sidicea** (also known as the **Betrayal of Sidicea** or **Revenge of Sidicea**) and allows him to march in on Cloudstride. The two commanders and their officers are executed in the city square and the remaining soldiers given the option to join their officers in death or give up their weapons and go to Mineos as slaves.

## The Capitulation of Niahal

With the coalition stretched and lacking resources, the navies flee from Niahal, allowing an enemy fleet from Kalens to enter without resistance in the **Capitulation of Niahal**. King Iro of Niahal welcomes them in and is allowed to continue as a tributary ruler. 

## Home Front
Calis's navy sends a small expedition to make a landing on Bourtias. Unable to mount a resistance, the city council gives in and Calis's officers begin establishing a base of operations on Bourtias.

On day 40, soldiers from the home guard unit arrive in the city, wild and crazed, speaking of Zulon and his infernal forces. With this information, people are anxious about the war as enemies are now on Argolos. The population becomes suspicious of their neighbors. People start hoarding what little food and supplies there are, leaving nothing for the poorest of the city. People stop trusting each other, only coming out on market day.

Hespero leaves for Aurochs Island as word reaches him that the Deathless One has returned to take over the island. As he arrives, so too do the 13 Islands and the heroes. Much like the hobbits, I mean halflings, at the end of *Lord of the Rings*, the Siege of Argot is truly like the Scouring of the Shire, for the heroes have returned wiser and more powerful than ever, but instead of Saruman it's Melkor (The Deathless One), but also Sauron (Zulon) is there too and he moved into your house instead of the Sackville-Bagginses. And I guess Mallory is like Gollum.

---

It is day 40 since the Battle of Aurochs Island. 

The Mineosi have taken Kalens, Telens, Niahal, Sidicea, Great Sickle, and Bourtias. 

Zulon is on Argolos Island. 

The Damage Sluts and the 13 Islands have returned to the material plane.
