title: Leandro Damaskenos
---

Leandro Damaskenos is one of the [[Ten Generals]] of Argot. He is a friend of [[Hespero]].

After [[Sora Nemmonis]] stole the love letters between Leandro and Damfina Colodrise (the wife of his friend and associate [[Armand Colodrise]] and mother of [[Taedor]], and spy for the [[Mineosi Empire]]), Sora applies pressure on Leandro to side with the [[Werriadi Republic]]. 

His wife, [[Allegra Damaskenos]], is killed by Livius and turned into a zombie in [[Am I being detained]]. Her unveiling as a Mineosi spy incentivizes Leandro even harder into promoting the Werriadi alliance. He gives an impassioned speech before the Assembly and the alliance is ratified.

He escorts [[The Argotnauts]] to [[Aurochs Island]] for [[Livius Anastasius Cratius]] to take his post as ambassador with 20 warships.

He, Armand, and Hespero lead Argot and the [[Golden Gulf Coalition]] against the [[Mineosi Empire]] during the first stages of the [[Argoti-Mineosi War]] ([[The 40 Days Campaign Diary]]).
