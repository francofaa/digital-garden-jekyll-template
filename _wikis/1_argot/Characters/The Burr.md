title: The Burr
---

The Burr was a Rakshasa lord who fought alongside [[The Lich of the Godsbody]] against [[Theo]], [[Fornorio]], and [[Hamiltonos Washington]]. He and the Lich controlled most of the Argolosi Peninsula for years, reigning over the area with an iron fist. The Burr was slain by [[Theo]] and [[Hamiltonos Washington]] before they were sent into the future, fatally wounded. The Lich kept [[Fornorio]] prisoner, eventually turning the man into [[The Ambassador]] hivemind. 

The Burr is likely a previous incarnation of [[Hespero]]. The Lich later became [[The Deathless One]].
