title: Duchess Serena
---

Yet another antagonist-ally, Duchess Serena of the Yagra Plain is a Nistoran Cloud Giant with aspirations to rule [[The 13 Islands of the Haunted Sea]]. She started this mission by killing [[Riffrick]], pinning it on [[Paloma]], impersonating [[Sora Nemmonis]] to get allies and get [[Paloma]] as a prisoner, manipulating [[The Argotnauts]] into destroying the island of [[Nistora]]  by dropping it into the ocean while she was safely on a magical cloud, which most likely diminished the grieving [[King Almsbrood]]'s support. 

Truly the nemesis and mirror image of Sora (both manipulative elderly monster women portrayed and voiced by men), the Duchess is an uneasy ally in the war against [[The Deathless One]].
