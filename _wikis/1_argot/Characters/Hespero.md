Hespero is the current incarnation of a Rakshasa previously known as [[The Hidimba]] and [[The Burr]]. 

He is a respected figure in Argoti society. He has a centuries-long vendetta against [[Aramestes]], [[The Deathless One]], despite having worked with him before when he was [[The Lich of the Godsbody]]. 

His vengeance is limitless and he has been engaged in a generations-long torturing of all those who fought against him and failed him during the War of the Devils and the Dead ([[13 Islands Lore]]). The extent of his vengeance was revealed in [[mast cure wounds]].
