General of the Cavalries of the [[Mineosi Empire]]

> The yellow-wreathed Mineosi infantry are joined by a cavalry of strange beasts and their riders. Leading the charge is a man in white shining armor, his white hair catching the breeze, and he rides a white saber-toothed lion with massive wings. Foot soldiers struck by his magical bolts are unable to recover, resistant to any potions or conventional medicine, as their flesh deteriorates. Others merely turn to ash as they get near. Those who survive speak of his lion, [[Cloudstride]], devouring the dead on the field. [[Helios]] is the rider's name and his magic burns like the sun.
