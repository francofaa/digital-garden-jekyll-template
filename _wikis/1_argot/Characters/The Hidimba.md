A young rakshasa with nothing to lose. Waged a war against [[Aramestes]] for the control of the 13 Islands. Petulantly banished the realm to a demiplane before being killed in an undisclosed manner.

Became [[The Burr]] and teamed up with [[The Lich of the Godsbody]], who was [[Aramestes]]'s next form before becoming the [[The Deathless One]].
