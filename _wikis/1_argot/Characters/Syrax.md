title: Syrax

The leader of the aerial forces of the [[Mineosi Empire]]. 

> The sailors point to the sky as they clash with the Mineosi navy. At first it seems to be a flock of ravens, but the birds grow larger as it becomes clear that these are monsters. They are clad in gold and black, their wings like bat wings. They swoop down and drop sailors into the sea, but they do not hunger for flesh: It is treasure they seek. Their leader, the fiend [[Syrax]] leaves a crew alive to deliver a message to the Argoti leadership: "You spend the blood of your people without a second thought. It is not what they want. So we shall strike where it truly hurts: your coffers." The city of Telens, bereft of resources and desperate for stability, capitulates.
