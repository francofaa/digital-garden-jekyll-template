She fought against siding with [[Duchess Serena]] and argued with [[Sora Nemmonis]] until parting from the group, along with Paloma, to stir up a resistance against the Duchess's plans. She was able to warn the tibbits of Hama before returning to the party to help with destroying the demon in Nistora.
