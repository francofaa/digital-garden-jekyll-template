title: Taedor
---

The son of [[Armand Colodrise]] and [[Damfina Colodrise]], Taedor was kidnapped by [[Baltsaros]] to be turned into one of [[The Ambassador]] hive mind bodies. After being rescued by [[The Argotnauts]], Taedor returned to a fairly ordinary life, you know aside from all the trauma he suffered, the political intrigue his family is involved in, and I guess, the war.
