Princess of the exiled fey folk on [[Lemba]]. After the heroes restored the Archdruid's Fountain, she offered to make the [[PS Admirable Effort]] fly and fulfilled that duty. But after that, the heroes kind of got on her bad side after allowing the fountain to get corrupted again and stealing flying ships and [[Abraham Washington]] killing one of her people.
