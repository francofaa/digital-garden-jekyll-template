title: Armand Colodrise
---

Husband of [[Damfina Colodrise]], a Mineosi spy who is sleeping with his friend [[Leandro Damaskenos]], and father to [[Taedor]], Armand is first met by the heroes in Hespero's shop, contracting them to rescue his son. 

After the incident at [[My Dinner with Hespero]], Armand and [[Hespero]] are under suspicion along with [[The Argotnauts]] for the murder of [[The Ambassador]] from Mineos. 

His wife is dramatically arrested for possession of a magical item, which she was using to spy with [[Allegra Damaskenos]] on the Argoti for the [[Mineosi Empire]]. After [[The Argotnauts]] are acquitted, the charges against Hespero and Armand are also dropped and they join with Leandro to lead the [[Golden Gulf Coalition]] during the first battles of the [[Argoti-Mineosi War]] ([[The 40 Days Campaign Diary]]).
