title: Temarian Yoldo and Sull
---
Temarian, Yoldo, and Sull were the three generals of [[Aramestes]] during [[The War of the Devils and the Dead]]. They were smushed together when Aramestes discovered they were pining after his sister [[Natalya]] and shirking their responsibilities. 

They were left on [[Iskos]] for the past 600 years to mourn at Natalya's tomb, not realizing that she had become [[The Alchemist]].

The people of Iskos believe them to be their lord Aramestes.
