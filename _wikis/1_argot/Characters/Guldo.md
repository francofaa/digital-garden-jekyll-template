One of the Mineosi bodyguards sent with [[The Ambassador]] to strike a deal with the Duergar of [[Aurochs Island]]. Tried to kill [[The Argotnauts]] along with the rest of his team, the Ginyu Force, but was spared. Since he had nothing else to do, he agreed to come with the heroes as part of the crew of the [[PS Admirable Effort]].
