title: Argot
---

Argot is the dominant city-state on Argolos Island and of the Sickle Islands. The government of Argot is a pure democracy, with many important political positions determined by lot. 

The culture has an anti-magic bias due to its foundation on a site of an anti-magic field. However, there is a thriving Undercity with an illicit trade in magical artifacts facilitated by [[Hespero]].
