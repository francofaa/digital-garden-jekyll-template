title: The War of the Devils and the Dead
---

The conflict that overtook the 13 islands and eventually led to its banishment as [[The 13 Islands of the Haunted Sea]]. Occurred 600 years before current events, the year 461 (that's right, I decided on a year!)

Waged between [[The Hidimba]] and [[Aramestes]].
