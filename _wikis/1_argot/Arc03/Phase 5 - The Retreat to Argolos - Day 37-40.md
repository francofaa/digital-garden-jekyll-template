# Phase 5: The Retreat to Argolos (Days 37-40)

*7 Midsummer 1061*

## The Capitulation of Telens
Telens falls on day 38 in the **Capitulation of Telens** as a massive fleet from the other side of the Sunrise Sea arrives, having picked up Podana troops along the way. 

> The sailors point to the sky as they clash with the Mineosi navy. At first it seems to be a flock of ravens, but the birds grow larger as it becomes clear that these are monsters. They are clad in gold and black, their wings like bat wings. They swoop down and drop sailors into the sea, but they do not hunger for flesh: It is treasure they seek. Their leader, the black-winged fiend [[Syrax]] leaves a crew alive to deliver a message to the Argoti leadership: "You spend the blood of your people without a second thought. It is not what they want. So we shall strike where it truly hurts: your coffers." The city of Telens, bereft of resources and desperate for stability, capitulates.

Clearly outnumbered, the skeleton force that survived the Battle of Telens Underbridge departs, the last of the ships fleeing by day 40, leaving no coalition navies in the Golden Gulf. General [[Theron]] is killed in the combat, his junior officers leading the retreat to Argot. News of his death arrives with the return of [[The Argotnauts]].

## The Second Siege of Sidicea

The city council of Sidicea, long languishing under the raids and pillaging of the coalition forces, betrays Commander [[Zosimo]] and General [[Cosmo]] to Helios in the **Second Siege of Sidicea** (also known as the **Betrayal of Sidicea** or **Revenge of Sidicea**) and allows him to march in on Cloudstride. The two commanders and their officers are executed in the city square and the remaining soldiers given the option to join their officers in death or give up their weapons and go to Mineos as slaves.

## The Capitulation of Niahal

With the coalition stretched and lacking resources, the navies flee from Niahal, allowing an enemy fleet from Kalens to enter without resistance in the **Capitulation of Niahal**. King [[Iro]] of Niahal welcomes them in and is allowed to continue as a tributary ruler. 

## Home Front
[[Calis]]'s navy sends a small expedition to make a landing on Bourtias. Unable to mount a resistance, the city council gives in and Calis's officers begin establishing a base of operations on Bourtias.

On day 40, soldiers from the home guard unit arrive in the city, wild and crazed, speaking of [[Zulon]] and his infernal forces. With this information, people are anxious about the war as enemies are now on Argolos. The population becomes suspicious of their neighbors. People start hoarding what little food and supplies there are, leaving nothing for the poorest of the city. People stop trusting each other, only coming out on market day.

[[Leandro Damaskenos]] receives a message from the new proconsul of Pontia, the Werriadi colony on Argolos. 

> General Leandro,
>
> I am arrived in my new role of proconsul at Pontia. Ambassador Serrat has apprised me of the military situation and I expect to be in Argot within the week with three legions of dragonborn to prepare for the defense of Argolos Island. After addressing your [[Ten Generals]], I will meet with you privately and anyone else you deem to be necessary.
> 
> I only eat lobster when I am traveling.

Hespero leaves for Aurochs Island as word reaches him that the Deathless One has returned to take over the island. As he arrives, so too do the 13 Islands and the heroes. Much like the hobbits, I mean halflings, at the end of *Lord of the Rings*, the Siege of Argot is truly like the Scouring of the Shire, for the heroes have returned wiser and more powerful than ever, but instead of Saruman it's Melkor (The Deathless One), but also Sauron (Zulon) is there too and he moved into your house instead of the Sackville-Bagginses. And I guess [[Malory Whisperbottom]] is like Gollum.
