# Omens: Experience and Leveling

When you miss a roll (6 or below), you receive 1 omen of your death. You may use 1 omen to:

- give yourself or someone else advantage on a roll (roll 3d6 and take the 2 highest dice as the result)
- inflict +1 damage on an enemy when inflicting damage
- reduce damage by -1 on yourself when taking damage

You may also spend 10 omens to offer a sacrifice to your god and trust that they will provide

- a familiar (to a max of 1)
- a branding, mutation, or implant to permanently increase a stat (to a max of 3)
- a branding, mutation, or implant to learn a new ability (move)
- a blessing (increasing faith by 1, to a max of 3)
- inspiration to create a haven
- an item of renown
- a vessel to contain a spell you have in your possession

After providing 5 times, your god may, in addition to the enhancements above, 

- reveal to you a potential acolyte (a second character to play)
- allow you to retire (narrate your epilogue)
  - Envision what you hope for and what you fear. Roll +faith. On a 10+, everything turns out as you hoped. On a 7-9, you are on a path you did not expect. On a miss, your fears come to pass.
