title: Relationships
---

For these non-player characters, give them backgrounds that make sense in terms of the players' relationships to them. Alternatively, anyone may randomize their backgrounds by rolling

- 1d3 for representative stat (grit, grace, wits)
- 1d3 for environmental background (wilderness, underworld, town)
- 1d6 for the background

This should be considered a guide rather than strict rules, and table talk should be allowed (but kept to a minimum for faster play) to smooth out any discrepancies.

1. Starting with the player on the herald's right, create and name aloud someone you despise. Name their traits and what your relationship is with them. Each player character then names their despised character. 
2. Starting with the player directly across from the herald, create and name aloud someone who you love. This should be a very strong relationship. Name their traits and what your relationship is with them. Each player then creates and names their characters.
3. Starting with the player on the herald's left, create the remaining minimum characters required for you to have for your background (children, siblings, coworkers, bosses, hirelings, etc).
4. Roll on or pick from the complications table and answer the prompt. (Alternatively, come up with your own prompt). When you name a person, you must choose a character that is *already available*. (This includes PCs, with strong caveats for some). If the prompt does not make sense, even after clever mental contortions or tweaks to the prompt, roll again, or come up with a prompt of your own.
5. Continue until everyone has answered a question at least once. Continue around the table, answering prompts with characters in mind. From this point on, you may create new characters to assign these complications to, if you feel inspired to do so.
6. If not already established, you, the other players, and the herald may discuss as a group what your relationships with one another are.
7. If not already established, you, the other players, and the herald may discuss as a group some of the relationships the NPCs have with one another.
