On a 10+, you take +1 forward for dealing with them as well. On a miss, they've heard of you, but the herald decides what they've heard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -                               |
| 5   | Backstab            | When you attack someone with a subtle weapon (blade, arrow, dart, needle) without their knowing, roll +grace. On a hit, inflict damage as established. 10+ both. 7-9, pick one:<br/>- You inflict double damage<br/>- You do it without being noticed<br />On a miss, the target sees you coming and you exchange damage as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | -                               |
| 6   | Precise Strike      | When you inflict damage on a monster, you may roll +grit. On a 10+, inflict +2 damage. On a 7-9, inflict +1 damage.

| 9   | Turn the Faithless  | When you want to banish a creature from a delineated space, roll +faith. On a hit, it is thrown outside of the space. On 7-9, it takes some time for the effect to work, allowing it to take actions and preventing you from taking actions as you concentrate on the effect. Any move to maintain concentration must be done as an act under pressure move. On a miss, something is keeping it in this place.                                                                                                                                                                 | 1 faith                         |
| 10  | Soothe Emotions     | While speaking to someone who is panicking, angry, or full of another negative emotion, you calm them down, even if the source of the emotion is still present, as long as they can hear you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1 faith                         |
| 11  | Divine Weapon       | Every dawn, you may imbue a weapon with holy energy by praying over it, sprinkling it with holy water, or performing some other ritual. Until the next dawn, the weapon counts as a magical weapon inflicting an additional +1 harm obvious (the weapon glows).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 1 faith                         |

| 13  | Foresight           | You foresee death. When you go into battle, roll +faith. On a 10+, name one person who will die and one who will live. On 7-9, name one person who will die OR one person who will live, NPCs only. On a miss, take -1 throughout the battle as you foresee your death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1 faith                         |

| 15  | Heal                | When you use medicine on an unstable target, roll +stock to heal them. On a hit, stabilize them and restore all hits past the stable line.
