# Stats

## Health
You have 7 HP. Once you pass 4 damage, you are considered unstable.

Every time the damage you take pushes you past the unstable line, you receive a permanent injury.

## Grit
*endurance, strength, power*
- Protect
  - When you protect someone from damage, roll +grit. On a 7+, you protect them but suffer some or all of the damage they were going to take. On a 10+, choose an extra effect: 
    - You suffer little damage (-1 damage)
    - You attract all the attention to you
    - You inflict damage on the enemy
    - You hold the enemy at bay
  - On a miss, the worst happens.
- Attack
  - When you have to fight someone, roll +grit. Exchange damage with the enemy as established. 10+, choose 2; 7-9, choose 1. On a miss, the enemy chooses 1 against you: 
    - You inflict terrible damage (+1 damage)
    - You suffer little damage (-1 damage)
    - You expose the enemy: take +1 forward or give an ally +1 forward against the enemy
    - You force the enemy where you want them
    - You seize something from them or keep something they are trying to take from you
    - You give yourself or someone else an opening to escape

## Grace
*instinct, agility, calm*
- Act under pressure
  - When you are performing an action under pressure, roll +grace. On a 10+, you do what you set out to do. On a 7-9, you are offered a difficult choice or you pay a cost for your action. On a miss, the worst happens.
- Help out
   - When you want to help someone, describe how and roll +grace. On a success, you grant them +1 to the roll. On a 7-9, you also expose yourself to danger. On a miss, you expose yourself to danger without helping.

## Wits
*personality, intelligence, cleverness*
- Manipulate someone
  - When you want someone to do something for you, give them a reason and roll +wits. On a 10+, the person does what you want them to do, until something betrays the reason you gave them. On a 7-9, they will do it but only if you provide assurances, corroboration, evidence, or something in return. On a miss, they may become hostile, uncooperative, or the situation may turn against you.
- Read a situation
  - When you read a situation to figure out what happened, roll +wits. 10+, hold 2; 7-9, hold 1. On a miss, the herald chooses 1, but also chooses the manner in which you learn it.
    - What happened here?
    - What did this?
    - What can it do?
    - What can hurt it?
    - Where did it go?
    - What was going to happen here?
    - What is being hidden here?
