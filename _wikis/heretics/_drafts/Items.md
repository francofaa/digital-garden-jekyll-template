# Items

All items have durability slots. Slots are expended on a miss when using the item. When all slots are marked, the item becomes scrap and can be repurposed to create new items. If an item has at least 1 durability slot, it may have a renewal/repair move available (for example, a sword requires a whetstone; a torch requires cleaning and wrapping).
