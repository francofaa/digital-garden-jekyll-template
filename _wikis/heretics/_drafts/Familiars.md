# Meet your familiar

Your familiar is your constant companion, a spirit inhabiting a creature of your choice, smaller than a large dog. You understand its animal-speak, and it understands you. It inflicts 1 damage hand. It has 4 health. When it suffers the last of its harm, it dissipates and can be summoned again.

Familiars may be used, at the gamemaster's discretion, as an arcane focus or a component for big spells or rituals.

To get to know your familiar, answer some questions:

- How did you meet your familiar? 
- What animal form does your familiar take on? 
- What is the significance of that animal form?

# Summoning
For all summonings after the first, refer to the move **summon familiar.** 

Offering for summoning (pick or roll 1):

- [ ] create reference card for filling out familiar stats 

# Familiar Bond Stat (optional)
The player may use the magic casting stat in the game to use the below moves. Alternatively, you may track the bond stat with the familiar. 

When you indulge your familiar when one of its negative traits is triggered, take +1 bond.

When you heal, soothe, or comfort your familiar at the expense of another action, take +1 bond.

When your bond reaches +4, reset it to +1 and confide one secret to your familiar.

When your familiar suffers harm that was the result of your actions, take -1 bond.

When your familiar suffers from its fear that you do not comfort right away at the expense of another action, take -1 bond.

When your bond reaches -3, reset it to 0.

The gamemaster may also use their discretion to determine when the stat changes.

# Familiar Moves

For the following moves, you would roll with the bond stat for your familiar. If there is a magical stat, you may discuss with your gamemaster whether it would make sense for the familiar to use that stat instead. 

Discuss with your gamemaster which moves may be available, or which moves can be added as leveling happens or critical moments in the story. 

## Channel 
When you try to experience your familiar's senses, roll +bond. Your familiar does not need to be within view to use this. On a hit, you sense everything your familiar does. 10+, choose 2; 7-9, choose 1:
- The effect lasts a long time
- You are able to go on speaking and moving
- You can control the familiar's movements

Miss, the familiar controls you. 

## Command 
When you want your familiar to do something within reason, roll +bond. On a hit, it follows your command
- 10+ exactly
- 7-9, imperfectly and/or its negative tag is triggered

On a miss, something goes awry

## Attack
When you command your familiar to attack an enemy, roll +bond. On a hit, harm is exchanged as normal. On a 10+, choose one extra effect: 
- Your familiar grants your party an advantage: take +1 forward or give +1 forward to another character
- Your familiar inflicts terrible harm (+1 harm)
- Your familiar suffers less harm (-1 harm)
- Your familiar forces the enemy where they want them
- Your familiar injects venom into the enemy (if familiar has +venom)
- Your familiar does not trigger a negative element tag (if familiar has +elemental)

## Omens
At the start of a new chapter in the game, roll +bond. Your familiar relays to you in a dream a portent of things to come. 

On a hit, if you prevent it from happening, mark experience. On a 10+, you take +1 forward when you act against it.

On a miss, the gamemaster holds 3 to use one-for-one as penalties against rolls you make.

## Poison/Venom
When your familiar is touched by another creature that can be poisoned, roll +bond. On a 10+, both; on 7-9, pick one: 
- The creature is now unstable
- The creature suffers 1 harm

## Resummon
When you summon your familiar after it dies, satisfy the conditions for summoning and roll +bond. On a 10+, pick one. On a 7-9, pick two: 
- Add a new fear to the familiar based on its manner of death
- Bond stat starts at -1 / Take -1 ongoing to familiar rolls
- One familiar move is unavailable

On a miss, the familiar is too weak, fearful, or resentful to return. It may be resummoned at a different time.

# For the gamemaster
Make the familiar real and have its own motivations. Don't forget that it wants to help the caster it is paired to. The bond that the caster has with the familiar may be new or old, but keep in mind any baggage an old relationship may have and any growing pains a new relationship would have in order to make that relationship feel real. The familiar is ostensibly a partner, not a subordinate, in a symbiotic relationship with the caster, and patterns of abuse may mean no amount of coins or prayers or interpretive dance will convince the familiar to return.

Make the familiar an ally. The familiar is not an extension of the player character. It is a new ally for the caster, and therefore, acts as an ally mechanically and is controlled by the gamemaster. This means the familiar may be negotiated with, be put in danger, and more.

Make the familiar feel eerie. This is not a pet; it is an otherworldly being tasked with assisting the player character. It is a strange creature with an unknowable true form and a mysterious origin.

Make the death of the familiar feel significant. Even though the familiar can be summoned, death is physically painful and mentally traumatic, and the familiar may feel resentment or gain a new fear upon its return.
