## Meanwhile…
Hotaru is in detention for stealing the test. Yoshiko and Sakushi come to help her and bribes the detention teacher by offering to get a green tea kitkat from the vending machine. Hotaru doesn’t want to be sprung out. Sakushi and Yoshiko give up. Hotaru shoves Yoshiko under a desk and covers her with a backpack to hide her from the teacher. Sakushi asks to get a detention as well and begins to sing. People begin to look out from their classrooms and the whole hallway comes to hear. Kabuto Karl is mesmerized and begins to openly weep. At the end of the song, the crowd of people rushes to the vending machines. Hotaru films the whole thing and decides that she can leave in the commotion with Sakushi.  A karaoke party ensues with the vending machines, which the janitor unlocks. 

Yoshiko and Hotaru go to the chem lab to make a love potion. The potion goes badly and explodes. Hotaru is tempted to steal more test answers, but is filming Yoshiko working on the potion. They hear that the party is beginning to die down and decide that they don’t have enough time to make another potion, so they rummage through the chem lab looking for good potion ingredients. Yoshiko finds a diary in the cupboards. 

As the party dies down and the three meet back up, Yoshiko and Hotaru see that Sakushi has cut her hair into a fashionable bowl cut with blue highlights. The diary is from the 1960s. In it, they find that the author of the book had dreams that were haunted by strange bug creatures, like 4 legged spiders. The diary describes the abandoned wing of the school and that there is a teacher, Ms. Yotari is acting strange. The diary author goes to investigate and never writes again.

Yoshiko, Hotaru, and Sakushi go to the abandoned wing to check things out. Hotaru turns on night vision mode to film. Sakushi realizes that she has heard of some sort creature from another dimension that comes into our world and warps reality. She read a few Creepy Pastas while not sleeping last night and remembers hearing that these monsters would wrap people up like spiders and will peel their faces off like masks and use the mask as a disguise to morph into the bodies. 

Hotaru takes out some gardening tool and tries to jab them into the wall to climb up. Hotaru climbs up and hears a hiss. Her towel hits a mound of silk and she falls to the ground. They give up.

## Up the mountain shrine

Everyone catches up via grouptext. 

Ichigo, Yuki, and Kaori have apprehended 2 people trying to dig up Sakushi’s tomb. They are holding them hostage at Ichigo’s house. Sakushi interrogates them. They said that they were robbing graves, but it sounds like they are lying. Sakushi slaps one of the lackies with her baguette and threatens him. Sakushi finds out that they were gathering ancient bodies to take them to a shrine for a scary lady named Yukigo. The shrine is in the mountains, 45 minutes from the Meizuo Mall. 

They go up the mountain to the shrine where Kaori had a near death experience. There is an old man on the path. The old man has a crystal that glows in the presence of other crystals so it lights up around Kaori. They jokingly insult the old man.Yoshiko tricks the old man into drinking a truth potion. Kaori asks the old man about hell rocks, he doesn’t. He reveals that a witch has taken over the shrine and bringing up bodies. He reveals way too much information, including that he has hemorrhoids, jacks off in the shrine, and thinks that Yuki is going to grow up to be super hot. They bully him until he runs away. 

## Yukigo, the snow witch

When they reach the cave, all of the crystals have vanished and it smells like dead bodies. Yuki uses her third eye to sense that the witch is there. She yells out a challenge to the witch and tells that she will defeat her or apprentice under her depending on how things go. The witch, Yukigo comes out with glowing blue eyes and in white robes. She breathes frost breath at Yuki. Sakushi demands to know why the witch was trying to dig up hr body. She asks Sakushi if she has come to join her collection. Yoshiko uses her gorgon powers on the witch and stuns her for a minute. Hotaru takes the opportunity to poke around behind her in the shrine and sees elegantly dressed corpses in various dignified poses. There is a blank spot in the tableau. Kaori transforms into Princess kNiGhT. Ichigo whacks the witch. 

Yuki hexes the witch with a binding spell to keep her from harming anyone. Sakushi follows Hotaru in the depths of the shrine and realizes that the scene set up is the scene of her own death— when she was poisoned. Yoshiko hits the witch and she collapses, but Yoshiko is unstable. The room becomes warmer as the witch melts and turns into a desiccated body. 

Yuki has secretly texted her almost boyfriend all the secrets that just happened. 

Yuki tries to take the curse off of Yoshiko, and succeeds, stabilizing her. But it doesn’t go great, and she gives Yoshiko a different problem— turning her slowly to stone. Sakushi gets into her place and realizes that she is looking at the corpses of her parents. The corpse of her younger brother is also there along with a courtier bring the tea. Behind a diving wall, there is a corpse of an old nanny who seems to have died at the same age as Sakushi remembers her at. She is holding a vial. 

They decide to try to summon the ghost of the shrine maiden that Kaori once met, but need some supplies, plus Yushiko is turning into stone. They decide to go see the school nurse, who might be able to help. Ichigo piggy backs Yoshiko back to school with an assist from Sakushi. 

## Back to school

Yuki goes to the hyberbolic math class to ask for a note and his books on magic. Both are denied.

Hotaru wants to check out his calendar and makes a fool of herself, mumbling something about shooting and then panicking and trying to steal kosuke’s milk. She is apprehended by Genji and Genji 2. Sakushi steps in and smooths things over. 

Yuki has lunch with Genji 2. 

Sakushi and Yoshiko go to synthesize the vial that Sakushi found in the shrine.
