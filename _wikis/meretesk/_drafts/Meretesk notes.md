Helewynn: Grimewater: Raised by grandmother, mother died, father ran away

Mike's Explorer: always dreamed of adventure. Local boy though, has been here for generations and generations. Generic human fighter. Father: You're a farmer, deal with it. Mom is more supportive. You could do other stuff, but too far and wide. From the farmlands, starts going into town, I can't just hoe and farm my way through things. Joined the town guard. Had a run-in with one of the smugglers or bounty hunters. Smuggling isn't bad. Town guard is for keeping the peace, not preventing underworld trade. Hespero's arcane library, celestial language. GODSBODY QUEST.

Blikz: These guys have too much red tape. I take care of what needs to be done. Silver Mountain. Meretesk, born into mining family, smart enough, fixing mining equipment, got enough money to get out.

# New campaign
The Village of Meretesk is a small town subject to the King of Gomotesk and run by a small town council and a mostly ceremonial rotating mayor chosen by lot. It spans the Merry River across a ford. 

To the east, the Merry River flows into the Golden Gulf, and across the Golden Gulf are the cities of the Golden League, and beyond, the Mineosi Empire, a multi-species realm, headed by the Deathless One, 

To the south, the road goes down to the town of Varak and further to the Argolosi Peninsula where the town of Argot dominates.

To the north, the road goes to Gomotesk, and further north is the city of Telens, which spans a narrow strait that connects the Golden Gulf to the Sunrise Sea.

To the west are the mountains and beyond it and the Werriadi Sea, the Werriadi Republic of dragonborn and its expanding empire.

Mountains bound Meretesk to the west, and the horizon is dominated by three peaks: 

- Godsbody Mountain, where the corpse of a calcified god fell millennia ago
- Glass Peak, where the source of the Merry River is and the Glass Falls flow down. An ancient wizard's tower is embedded in a sheer cliffside of the mountain
- Silver Mountain, where the silver mines that sustain much of the town's industry are

The Snarlwood is at the foothills of the mountains, and are the only part of the woods of Meretesk that have remained standing since the region's settlement. The Snarlwood is said to be home to a lion, a witch, and a pit straight to hell. 

The village itself is small and humble, dominated by a town square on the northern bank of the river. Market day occurs here once a week. 

There is a wealthy sorcerer named Hespero who lives in the nice part of town. He is known to be a collector of magical artifacts. 

There is a military outpost at the fork in the road where the road splits off toward the silver mines. 

Tech level is Classical Mediterranean. Magic level is light: Magic is very rare but it is known to exist. 

It is a small town, population in the 5,000 to 10,000 range, no city walls to speak of, and is mostly single level homes, no apartment blocks. The tallest buildings would be religious buildings. There would be a few taverns, baths, temples, and other places of interest. Most people know each other. 

Character Stipulations: 
- Most backgrounds are OK. Let me know if there is something that you want to use that might seem like it doesn't fit and we can make it work 
- It would be preferable if you were all locals to the area, grew up there, or had ties to the area. 
- All classes and subclasses are OK, but I don't recommend blood hunter. It's not very good. 
- All species are available but the predominant ones in the town would be humans, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings.

Here are some collaborative world-building questions: 
- Centuries ago, a demon was destroyed in Meretesk. Why and how was it destroyed?
- How do you all know each other? 
- Where in town do you live?
- What are some places you haunt? 
- Who are the people you know in town? (Friends, family, rivals)
