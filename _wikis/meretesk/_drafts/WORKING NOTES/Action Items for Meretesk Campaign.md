Random table rolling: 
- Have heroes roll random encounter themselves
- Once per hour or once per moment of idleness or indecision (even in overworld) or when resting or spending a lot of time in a hostile area (like investigating, building stuff)
-  Have each player roll a d8

adventuring day budget!

travel: make every encounter deadly

restock dungeon after the heroes long rest when they don't need to 


Here follow general notes and things to keep in mind for the Meretesk Campaign and for future hex crawl style campaigns where I am trying to encourage the players to create their own story rather than corralling them into a plot. 

# Dungeon Design
Dungeon crawling should promote **exploration**. 

NPCs within the dungeons require a 
- worry
- goal
- appearance quirk

Add a clock on quest deadlines

- Multiple entrances
- Purpose
- Levels sign-posted with difficulty 
- Loops
- Verticality 
- Secret areas
- Weirdly shaped rooms
- Debris, cover
- Verb-able environment (such as a collapsing ceiling trap during a battle)
- Recognizable features
- Architectural motifs to separate zones
- Tactical features: Bridges, chokepoints, uphill areas, doors
- Spying opportunities: Portcullises, echoey rooms, one-way mirrors, speaking tubes
- Wandering monsters: Threats that appear if heroes linger for too long
- Evidence of monsters, such as 
   - tracks
   - bloody tracks
   - carcass of recent kill
   - remains of campsite 
   - droppings
   - graffiti 
- A friendly or neutral NPC to break up the terror and claustrophobia of a dungeon 
- Descriptions of upcoming rooms in a dungeon (so that the direction to go is meaningful)
   - rely on five senses (you hear something down this hall, you smell something down that hall, etc)
- Events and activities (like mining operations or a feast)
- Countdowns and escalations: Crumbling, summoning a demon, creatures transforming into more powerful versions of themselves, flooding, etc)
- Side quests (such as hidden things within the dungeon)
- Traps that the heroes can trigger on the enemies 




## Tower of the Wizard of Glass

Have more glass themed things! Mirrors! Also don't forget the ducks. OMG A furnace, of course! Starting the furnace starts the tower collapsing. Starting the furnace is required to mend the key to open the doors. Bursting glass traps

## Ideas 
- Prayer cabinets
- dead monastics 
- prayer scrolls pinned to a wall or rock face 
- The vampire spawn in the dungeon has been feeding on people in the surroundings
- A powerful ghost creature that is maybe found in the abandoned village https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/909484-ghostblade-eidolon
- Two headed cerberus: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/909513-two-headed-cerberus
- Oracle https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/909498-oracle
- magic paintings that the artist can spy through that are sold to wealthy people (maybe he travels through them to murder people)
- NPC is destroying orchids so they can corner the market on orchids to sell them at exorbitant prices
- What can the macguffin do apart from what the villain wants it for? 
- The antagonist must want macguffins that are scattered all through the map

## Quick Build Tips

1. Something old: What was this place used for?
2. Something new: What is happening now that the heroes must solve?
3. Something borrowed: Monsters, characters, treasures, etc that already exist that you know about 
4. Something blue: Something that makes you sad/emotion, something that makes you feel something

Start from the inside out (from the final boss and treasure room to the entrances). Plan set pieces, not puzzles



# Overworld Map Design
Information that the heroes have about the world is imperfect. 

- River communities (rivers systems are transpo highways)
- Aquifers and water sources
- Mining, ores
- Fossil fuels
- Leyline intersections
- Mana crystal mines
- Magic mushroom forests

How do these interact? For instance, a wizard builds a tower that threatens a druid's grove 

Add adventure sites and settlements in equal numbers. For each settlement, consider 
- trade 
- craft 
- commodity 
- unusual beliefs 
- unique things 

Examples would include tulip / orchid market, people taking a siesta every day. 

With each location, start with a bad status quo. 




## Ideas
- The duchy that rules over Meretesk is what?
- Where do the black ships go?
- Poison being fed to people 
- Ash rain
- Where the bodies wash up
- Poachers 
- Example: Villagers burning the effigy of a dead king. Burning effigy is extinguished by a cold wind. Pay off of the festival role play. Dungeon is a crypt, cold gusts of wind blow out their torches, goblins wanna run away from the ice troll king. Part of the puzzle encounter. Setback: Treasure buried with the hated king. King is not dead and wandering around somewhere. Even help from the goblins against the king.

# PC Prep
Make note of everyone's 

- HP
- AC with and without armor and shields 
- Passive abilities



# Combat
1:10 rule: given one minute to make up their mind about what they want to do

If you stay under your time limits, you get bonus treasure when you end the adventure 

If you don't stay under, you move the character down in the initiative order 

Come up with a decision tree for your monsters: 
- When do they attack
- when do they run
- who do they target?

- Ranged combatants
- melee combatants that targets people who could target their archers. Locking foes in position
- battlefield control spells: like three of them for battlefield control: entangle, sleet storm, fog cloud, web, gust of wind, darkness; protecting the melee and ranged fighters. New puzzle per turn

How far are bad guys willing to go? Should they run away? What are their motivations?

Donâ€™t attack your players weaknesses, attack their strengths. 

Let their abilities be used. Shoot your monks




# Treasure Hoard Tables
Include treasure maps to lead heroes to certain places to search for treasures

What are all the treasures they should be looking for?





City of the hanging gardens
