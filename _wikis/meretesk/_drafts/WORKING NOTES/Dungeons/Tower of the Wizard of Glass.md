title: Tower of the Wizard of Glass
aliases: [The Glass Tower]
---

```ad-history
This is the second Malork's research tower. He would revisit it many times during his life, but the first time he was using it was when he fought against the Salt King. He abandoned his friends to die along with the Salt King, with Wynnfred and he being the only survivors, in order to retrieve the Salt King's book, which contained notes on a dragon orb that the Salt King hoped to develop in order to control the Sleeper Queen. 

```

```ad-Secrets
- A cultist of the **Salt King** named **Tal** has hired a crew of bandits to infiltrate the wizard's tower and steal the book. His diary can be found in **4**, the base camp in the dining room. 
- **Malork** fell to his death while reading his spellbook. Likely a malfunction of his **glass construct**. 
- When the tower collapses after the heroes retrieve the book, the **Sorrowsworn** escape through the crack in the wall and into the **Silver Mines**.
- **Keystones**: When stacked together, this key can access doors with that number of triangles or lower. Therefore, a three-key can access a one-door but not a four-door (refer to key door warning). Turning the key, however, can increase the number of triangles up to the number of keystones in the key. However, it can only be turned to four positions, representing each of the doors. The five-key can only open the five-door.
```

```ad-warning
title: Key Door

If the key is turned too far and is not the right level of key, the turning of the key must make a DC 10 WIS save or be turned into a duck per the polymorph spell for 10 minutes.

# Hook
Hespero tasks you with retrieving a notebook from the study of the Wizard of Glass. It should be inscribed in the first page with a name written in Celestial, meaning *He Who Visits*. 

Hespero gives you **keystone 1**, which has a notch across its diameter and protrusion in the same line and tells you that you can open the front door with it. 

# Outside

On the approach, there are three visible ways in: The front door (**1**), a gap in the side of the tower 125 feet up (**5**), and a strange hole at the top of the tower, 205 feet up (**8**).

A fresh corpse can be found nearby. The corpse is an elf woman with a long sword, 5 gp, and 20 feet of rope. 

Climb DC's will be made with athletics. Using sufficient rope will eliminate the need for a check. Otherwise, failures on the climbing check will result in the climb requiring double the time to complete it otherwise would (to account for the characters being careful.)

# 1 Midden 
> The door is shut. A circular indentation is on its front with a single triangle at the top. 

> A dark circular room with four pillars in the middle. There is a repulsive stench. No clear path out. 


With light, one can see duck motifs along the top of the ceiling. 

Once used as a sitting room, this was converted to a midden after Malork realized he never had any guests. 

**Trash cart** with a mountain goat skeleton attached. Searching through the trash cart reveals a **keystone 2** which has a notch across its diameter and a protrusion in the same line. 

**Wheel** mechanism used to open and close water.

**Three levers** in closed positions, used to open the traps above (1a, 1b, 1c).

The **hatches** above from the traps 1a-c can be climbed up to to enter **3**. Spikes are clearly visible on the underside. The traps contain the bodies of failed experiments. 

There is a secret entrance to **2** via a crack in the wall. This can be detected with a DC 10 investigation or perception check. 

## 1a-c Traps
- 1a (leftmost): 1 [Boneless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1680917-boneless) attached to a [Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17015-skeleton) and another Skeleton. The Skeleton will rip its skin off and the Boneless will attack as well.
- 1b (middle): 3 [Skeletons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17015-skeleton)
- 1c (rightmost): nothing

# 2 Scaffolding
A towering **scaffolding** is on the outside of this wall inside of a cavern. It is pitch black back here. There are extinguished **lanterns** on the outside walls but they are covered in cobwebs. 

A dying [bandit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16798-bandit) is here who will say that he was just hired to do a job to get some stupid book. "We were all trying to get in different ways. The elf fell to her death climbing up the wall like a dope." He asks for help. He has a 30 feet of rope and says that he fell trying to climb up the scaffolding after his lantern snuffed out and he couldn't see anymore.

75 feet up there is a ledge that leads to **4**. 

Climbing up further up a rickety **scaffolding** (which requires a **DC 10 athletics check** to continue up and a subsequent **DC 10 dexterity** saving throw to prevent fall damage and avoid the collapsing structure). This next landing is 145 feet up total (70 more feet up) the dangerous scaffolding. This enters into **9**.

# 3 Laboratory
A laboratory with trap doors. Three failed experiments are within the tanks. If they are released, these are 2 [Wretched Sorrowsworn Worms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560963-wretched-sorrowsworn), grown from the worms on Embara, and 1 [Hungry Sorrowsworn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560849-hungry-sorrowsworn).

The Alchemist is here as well. She will provide you information as she continues to brew something with the dust of some sirablood. As you enter she has failed to create something. She continues working without taking notice of you. If you ask her nicely, she will give you a **keystone 3**.

The spike traps are triggered by stepping over them and require a DC 15 dex save to avoid falling into, or else taking 2d4 piercing damage from the spikes. 

There is another **wheel** here, though this one is broken and will not turn back off if you turn it. There is a **water tube** here that you can enter without turning the wheel at all. This takes you into **8**. 

Turning the wheel all the way will flood the room and make the tube dry. A corpse will fall out, a dagger in her back. 

At the back of the room, there is a chest. The **chest** (DC 10 thieves tools) contains **two potions of lesser healing**. 

# 4 Unfinished Floor
Meant to be a dining room, this floor was never finished since Malork didn't have any friends. This can be accessed via the scaffolding in **2** or by coming from the overhang above in **5**. 

A [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/370794-spellcaster-mage) can be found here. He lies and declares himself to be the Wizard of the Tower. "Cower before me, mortal!"

In truth, he is a cultist of the Salt King named Tal who has hired a crew of bandits to infiltrate the wizard's tower and steal the book. 

His diary can be found in the tent along with 100 feet of rope and 5 torches. 

# 5 Caved-in Dining Room
Can be accessed by climbing up the side of the tower or by climbing up from **4**. The door at the other end can only be opened by a 2-keystone key.

2 [Swarms of Mechanical Spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/285351-swarm-of-mechanical-spiders) make their home in the ruins. A wall can be climbed up easily to the kitchen in **6**.

# 6 Caved-in Kitchen
Contains a hearth with a chimney that is a secret passage up into **7a** hypocaust. 2 [Smoke Mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17174-smoke-mephit) live inside the chimney. Climbing down goes to **5**. There is a **wheel** that unleashes water into the room. Swimming into it or climbing into it after it is emptied goes into **8**.

# 7 Bath
A **corpse** clutching a **necklace with a ruby (worth 100 gp)**. He looks as if he was boiled to death (killed by steam mephits). 

This area can be entered via the **hypocaust** **7a** or the tube **8**. Turning the wheel empties the water into the bath and empties the tube. Turning it back fills the tube back up. Spilling the water out also reveals 2 [Steam Mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17022-steam-mephit).

## 7a Hypocaust 
Entering in via **6** and **7a** places the character into the hypocaust under the bath. Coals are here scattered about. Bones of humanoids are here as well. This area can be exited via a hatch. 

# 8 Tube
A long **tube** delivers water throughout the tower. It dumps water into the baths **7**, the lab **3**, the kitchen **6**, and the glass-blowing chamber **9**. It can be entered into by climbing the tower. A **corpse** is in this tube, stabbed in the back, and can be dumped into the lab **3** if the characters turn the water **wheel**.

The tube will fill back up with water magically if the water **wheel** is turned back the other way in any of the rooms (but the wheel in **3** is broken and can only be turned on). 

Without water the tube is a difficult climb, and the player characters will have to squeeze their way up at quarter speed. 

Swimming up can be done as well. 

A **keystone 4** is at the end of the tube leading into the glassblowing workshop **9**.

From the tube, the characters can see the underside of the hourglass where the door to **10** is. Viewing the workshop **9** from the tube, it appears to be an impossible space based on where it is in relation to the rest of the tower. 

```ad-warning
title: warning
Characters can hold their breath for 1 + CON minutes or 30 seconds, whichever is longer. When out of breath, a character has CON x rounds before dropping to 0 HP.
```


# 9 Glassblowing Workshop
This is the only room that is lit. Slits from the outside world shine in from above. A glass dome encases this room. 

**Furnaces** line the wall. A lever begins bellows inside of the furnaces but there is no heat source. 

A **glass blowing station** is at the far right with [glassblowers' tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/glassblowers-tools) on a table. A long scooping device is against the wall to the **door**. **6 hourglasses** are lined up along the wall. 

A **ladder** leads down 50 feet into the pit below where **broken glass** is scattered. The broken glass is difficult terrain. Glass mallards are scattered at the bottom as well, all broken. Among the broken glass, with a careful DC 10 check of whatever makes sense, the characters can find an [orb of time](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/27078-orb-of-time) among the refuse. 

Landing on the broken glass inflicts 2d6 piercing damage. 

In order to mend the **keystones** together, you must melt them together using the furnace. 

The **wheel** at the leftmost end of the room opens and refills the water in **8**. The water spills into a small yet deep pool underneath. 

A massive **hourglass** is below, the sand on the top part of the hourglass. 

A [fire snake](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17199-fire-snake) lives in the sand of the hourglass. Any disruption to the surface awakens the snake. A **keystone 5** sits atop the surface.

Figuring out how to start the hourglass will cause it to flip after the sand collects in the bottom half. The sand is started by disturbing the surface. Flipping exposes the door to **10**. Otherwise, the bottom is sealed against the floor.

Walking across the sand to access the door starts the sand timer again. 

The hourglass contains a full hour of sand.

# 10 Malork's Study
Accessible via the door under the **hourglass** in **9**. 

```ad-note
Clever characters can turn the keystone halfway between four and one to access the room via any of the doors as well. 
```

Careful investigation will reveal that everything in the room is bolted down. 

A long window of **stained glass** goes all the way around the room. Touching any of the books in the study will cause the stained glass to turn into a [glasswork construct](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979785-glasswork-golem) (activating the alarm that Malork set up long ago). The construct will attack. 

A **telescope** is pointing out the window. Looking into it will show the wormy shores of the island of Embara. 

If somehow the sand in the hourglass completes a full hour, the room will flip upside down. 

```ad-loot
- Notebook of the Salt King, 200gp if turned into Hespero
- Telescope, 100gp
- Deck of Divination Cards, 1gp
- Wooden mallard, 1cp

```

Opening any of Malork's notebooks reveals the following phrases obsessively written over and over (among variously incoherent and esoteric notes): 

>  GUILT IS A USELESS EMOTION. You did what you had to do. The salt dries all. They would have wanted you to have it. One step closer. One step out.

Inside the **Notebook of the Salt King** is the schematics for an orb written in draconic.
