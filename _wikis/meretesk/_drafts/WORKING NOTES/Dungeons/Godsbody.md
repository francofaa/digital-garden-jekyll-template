```ad-history
- A god fell here long ago. 


```

```ad-Secrets
- A liminal arrow is lodged in the wall of the womb (8)
- The heart (9) is full of god ichor
- Attacking the tissue of the insides will cause an icy breath to expell, inflicting 2d6 cold damage.
```


The inside of the Godsbody is completely white and ashen. Breaking into the inside tissue releases a cold gas which inflicts 2d6 cold damage, after which the tissue repairs itself magically. 

# 1 Wing Ice Sheet
There are 3 Frost Giant Skeletons (or Frost Giants, if running Meretesk) on the ground here. They will stand if people approach within 10 feet. The incline and iciness is difficult terrain without proper crampons. Any shove action will result in the target falling and slipping down the ice 30 feet. 

```ad-note
title: Shoving

Using the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check contested by the target’s Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated). If you succeed, you either knock the target [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) or push it 5 feet away from you.
```

# 2 Skull
A desiccated brain is latched onto a large calcified brain. There are gaps in the white crust showing a red and pink surface. Four Mindwitnesses are here, moving back and forth across the room, maintaining the elder brain's vining.

A vining network of purple and black spreads across the entire inside of the skull and continues halfway down the spine, twisting into the spinal cord. The vining has an AC 10 (natural armor) to sever (slashing or fire damage). Severing the vining at all causes the mindwitnesses in the room to take notice and attack. 

Attacking the vining with psychic damage (AC 10) will inflict that damage on the Elder Brain, but it will awaken and attack. 

A crack goes into (2) and a wide opening goes into the neck (5). 

# 3 Nose and Jaw
There are 10 hollyphants floating around here. They are removing the vining from the inside of the nose cavities. A narrow crack goes into the skull (2). 

# 4 Arms Ice Sheet
There are 3 Frost Giant Skeletons (or Frost Giants, if running Meretesk) on the ground here. They will stand if people approach within 10 feet. The terrain is hilly and has cover. Entrance to (3) is visible.

# 5 Neck
The hallway of the neck has vocal cords hanging above. They are covered in the elder brain's vining. Removing the vining and striking the vocal cords will cause a divine sound emerge which will restore 3d12 HP to any creature who can hear once per day. 

Opening to the skull (2) and narrow crack into (6) below and (5).


# 6 Lung
Entrance from (5) is covered in webs. Can be easily burned or slashed away (AC 10, HP 5, vulnerable to fire. Immune to poison and psychic). 

```ad-danger
title: Webbing

Touching the web results in the target being [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by webbing. While [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) in an ice spider’s web, a creature takes 1 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, the [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to poison, and psychic damage).

```

An abandoned shrine at gigantic scale is here. Extinguished candles cover the shrine. The shrine has a faceless winged statue featured here. An inscription in Giant reads "The deadgod will live again." Frost Giant bones litter the floor (but not in undead form). 

Corpses are here, wearing the cloaks of cultists of the deadgod. They wear black and white-lined robes with glass amulets containing **god ichor**. The glass has the design on it of a shape of a body in the fetal position (how the godsbody is positioned).


```ad-loot
- God ichor which reacts to sirablood and disables both. 


```


These corpses when touched become Coldlight Walkers (5 of them). When they are killed, **they cannot be raised from the dead**.

A trio of giant sized chests containing 8,000 gp are here.

There are 10 ice spiders in the entrance of the bronchial tubes. 

Opening to (5), (7), and (9). 

# 7 Stomach
An expanse of acid (2d10 acid damage to the touch) fills the stomach. There are 3 Adult Oblexes here. Entrance to (6) and (7). Another exit into (12). 

# 8 Womb
The air here is stale and there is a glittery substance all around. 

Cocooned Godseed Giants are here, 7 of them (Doomwake Giants). There are broken entrances to (7), (10), and to the outside in front of an opening to (11). The arrow is lodged in the cocoon of one of the giants. Removing it will awake the giant who will chase the characters in fear and confusion. Any of the other giants will awaken with sufficient noise (on subsequent turns if one awakens.)

# 9 Heart 
The heart is entered via a crack in the heart. A valve on the left and right is closed. Applying electrical pulses opens a valve. Opening the valve in 9(3) causes the red god ichor from that chamber to enter the current chamber and fill it up to the top. 

The god ichor can be collected. 

```ad-loot
- God ichor which reacts to sirablood and disables both. 


```

# 10 Pelvis
A hollowed out refuge that opens to the outside (mainly to (12), (8), and (14) via the outside. There are signs of a former Frost Giant camp here. 

# 11 Thigh
There are 3 Ice Trolls in the caverns of the hollowed out thigh. They gnaw on the corpse of a dead frost salamander. A cauldron is here as well. 

Bones litter the floor. 

# 12 Ribcage
Ribs create a roof. Snow and ash fall from the ribs. Any loud noises or violence will cause chunks of the rib cage to fall. A creature must make a DC 15 dex save or suffer 3d6 bludgeoning damage. 

Frost Salamanders patrol here, 4 in total, which also venture into the (14) area. **Roll 1d4 to determine how many are in the ribcage.**

# 13 Legs Ice Sheet
There are 3 Frost Giant Skeletons on the ground here (or Frost Giants, if running Meretesk). They will stand if people approach within 10 feet. The terrain is hilly and has cover.

# 14 Spine
The elder brain vining expands halfway down the spine. Frost Salamanders patrol here, 4 in total, which also venture into the (12) area. **Roll 1d4 to determine how many are in the spine.**
