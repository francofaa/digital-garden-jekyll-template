In the tomb, the **Thirsting Blade** whispers in a muffled voice. It desires a new owner. 

```ad-loot
- Thirsting Blade: Can only be sheathed after it drinks blood. +1 blade that can be affixed to the end of a pole-arm. If the blade is removed from its sheath, it will chatter with the voices of the dead until sheathed. Anyone within 10 feet of the sword will be unable to benefit from a long rest. On a natural 20, this blade deals an additional 14 slashing damage and the target has a limb severed.
