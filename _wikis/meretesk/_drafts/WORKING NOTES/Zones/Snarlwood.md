## Snarlwood
The Snarlwood is dominated mainly by elves and the fey folk who live in the Silverdew Court, run by the [[Marquise Sinra Silverdew]]. A soothsaying cunning woman [[Snallygaster]] has a moving hut in these woods and is said to provide fortune telling services to those who give her something she does not know she wants.

Undead sometimes haunt these woods, a consequence of the abandoned Orphans' Cemetery, a former lichfield full of ancestor shrines that was reclaimed by the forest. The unsettled spirits here are unsettled even further by the recent opening of a sinkhole where a vampire's lair can be found.

The fleecmane lion with its magical mane can be found here in its lair. The elves sworn to the Silverdew Court have vowed to protect it.

The people here worship the [[Unborn Mother]].
