## Taruna Lake Woods
The lakeside woods of Taruna contain the Abbey in the Wilderness in [[The Wilderness Parish]], a long abandoned abbey that houses the Hall of Vanquished Lies. Creatures make their lair here. Elves, loggers, and druids also make their home in this region, long abandoned by the Parish authorities and left alone by the Lord of the Taruna March.

An oni named Zburator haunts these woods while a coven of Sea Hags make their lair somewhere on the shore as they attempt to break into the Sleeper's Tomb. 

[[Zburator]] seduces and kidnaps beautiful women. After impregnating them consensually, he insists that they drown their children or else he will leave them. He steals the caul that the child is born with (as all half-oni are born with) and uses it to bind the soul of the mother when she dies (which is often soon after due to being wracked with grief). He keeps the souls in the cauls and gives them to the sea hags. The sea hags use the cauls in their potions and spells. Zburator eats his dead sons and grows in power. His lair is in the Abbey.
