## Western Woods
The Western Woods are in the Maramoor March. Here can be found the Maramoor Fortress hidden in the hilly woods. 

There is an ancient overgrown ruin, an old hall of the [[Old Growth Ilsovi]], an ancient fey-touched people (Eladrin) who once lived here. The trees are ancient and protect themselves. 

An Archdruid named [[Archdruid Luren]] keeps a druid circle here and seeks help with undead that are emerging from the ruins. They seek to re-sanctify the woods, but have little help from the people of the Maramoor March since they think they collaborate with the gnolls. 

Couatl make their home in the forest as well and grace lucky travelers with their presence.
