## Taruna Lake
Taruna Lake is a large body of water in the Taruna March. At the southern edge of the lake is the Taruna Fortress, seat of the Lord of the Taruna March. The Tomb of the Sleeper is at the bottom of the lake. 

The [[Sleeper Queen]] fought the [[Salt King]] in ages past and sacrificed herself to defeat him along with the heroes of old.

White flamingos reside here, sometimes venturing to the Salt Flats to feast on purple grubs.
