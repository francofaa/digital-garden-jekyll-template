## Salt Flats
The Salt Flats are an expansive desert where salt harvesters and scientists from far and wide visit to harvest salt and conduct experiments. 

Flamingos travel here from Taruna Lake to feast on purple grubs. Feeding on these grubs turns their feathers purple, which is a draw for some adventurers seeking to make some money off of the feathers. When the bird is killed, there is a 30 second window before the color is drained from the feather when a preservative can be used to freeze the pigmentation loss. 

A purple worm lives underground, which is where these grubs are coming from. 

A festival is held here once a year called [[Burning Lich]] where the effigy of a lich is burned to celebrate the destruction of the [[Salt King]] millennia ago. Some say, however, that the Salt King still sleeps beneath the salt. 

**Special Effect:** *Saltwind*. Supernaturally powerful winds, a salt wind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to salt and grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes **1d4**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

Saltwind leaves **4d6**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) or ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check or Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)) check allows a character to recognize a saltwind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A saltwind typically lasts **1d4**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) Ã— 10 hours.
