## Northern Mountains
To the north of the [[Merry River]] and the [[City of Gomotesk]] lie the Northern Mountains of the [[Visigoara Duchy]]. [[Visigoara Castle]] seat of [[Duke Solomnar Izmesuj]] sits in the foothills of the mountains and within the mountains reside various undead, particularly vampires. 

A topaz dragon makes its home in a burrow in the mountains, long sleeping thanks to the efforts of the Duke of Visigoara, who is in fact an ancient vampire. A long spell of dreaming has kept the topaz dragon [[Balaur]] asleep.

The Vampire Duke of Visigoara travels a lot when he is thirsty and visits various towns in his duchy, and at times even ventures into the rest of Gomotesk. 

[[Hespero of Meretesk]] seeks to awaken this dragon and control it, in an effort to threaten the kingdom and take it over.
