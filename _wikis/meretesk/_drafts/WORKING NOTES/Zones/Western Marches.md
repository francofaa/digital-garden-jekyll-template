## Western Marches
The Western Marches are menaced by the gnolls and their wargs, and dinosaurs run rampant. It is a dangerous land, patrolled by the lords of the Kriska, Taruna, and Maramoor Marches. Many soldiers of the March escort foreign caravans into the City of Gomotesk, causing many goods from the west to be very costly due to the tariff that Kriska takes. 

The Cadaver Collector cleans up the battlefields of the western marches while the humanoids and gnolls fight against one another. The Cadaver Collector was an ancient construct that was made by the Salt King centuries ago. It still collects bodies to this day. The souls are lost and retrieving the souls from the Collector is something that every warband and unit seeks to do. 

If the Salt King or a necromancer were ever to claim this cadaver collector, they would be able to use the captured souls to create an undead army. 

The Gnolls group themselves into warbands and often compete with each other for lands and resources, allowing the patrols to keep them in line. The gnolls consider Kriska Fortress to be the greatest prize due to its position as a rest stop for caravans. Some of the gnoll warbands have engaged in necromancy and sorcery to achieve these aims.
