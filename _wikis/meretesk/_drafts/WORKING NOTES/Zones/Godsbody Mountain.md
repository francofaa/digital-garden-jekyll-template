## Godsbody Mountain
The Godsbody Mountain is home to, of course, the Godsbody, a calcified god that fell from the heavens in ages past. The mountains are home to the [[Frost Giants]] who dwell inside of the Godsbody. When they discovered an entrance into it, they fought a war with the [[Stone Giants]] for dominion over the locale. The Frost Giants have started a mystery religion all for the worship of this calcified god and protecting it.


[[Queen Giant Cingalau]] and the [[Giant Priest Capacanul]] rule over the Frost Giants.
