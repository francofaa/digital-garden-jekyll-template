## Glass Peak and Silver Mountains
Within the [[Silver Mountain]] is the [[Goblin Town]] and the [[Silver Mines]]. The [[Cold Prince]] also resides here, exiled from the Silverdew Court. He is seeking someone to place him back on the throne. In the mountains, there is the Source of the [[Merry River]] where the [[Oracle]] resides nearby in a cave. The [[Brangwen]] also lives in these mountains. 

Brangwen wants to restore the Cold Prince to his throne so that he will let the hag be his queen. She too wants to return to the [[Snarlwood]]. To this end, she uses goblin children and miners' children to spy on people.
