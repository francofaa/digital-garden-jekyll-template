## Giants' Reach
Giants' Reach is run by a giantsmoot headed by Stone Giants who were driven out of the Godsbody Mountain by the [[Frost Giants]]. Previously, the region was called Bright Reach, a land under the dominion of [[Siblune Duchy]]. The land was taken over by the [[Salt King]]. He was defeated by a group of heroes after the demise of the [[Sleeper Queen]]. When the town was destroyed, the Frost Giants and [[Stone Giants]] went to war over a disagreement and the Stone Giants were driven into the Reach. 

The nomadic people the [[Avarchi]] live in the foothills under a truce with the giants. The people of the Siblune Duchy and authorities look down on the Avarchi, especially due to the truce.

Revenants and undead of Blight Town also venture into the foothills. The old Siblune Castle, abandoned now, contains undead as well (the ghosts of those who failed to defend it, including a Banshee and a vampire gnoll that was buried long ago to stop its rampaging). The Avarchi know the mountain passes well to avoid the haunted castle and traverse the marches to the west.

The burial mound of a Siblune King lies a short ride from the new Siblune Castle. A troll camp and the [[Giantsmoot]] (an ancient ruin of the and meeting hall ) are also found in Giants' Reach.

### Dungeons
- 20: [[Burial Mound of the First King of Siblune Dmitry]] DUNGEON

- R: [[Old Siblune Castle Ruins]], old seat of the Duke of Siblune DUNGEON. A banshee resides here, the [[Princess Hilde Banshee]] who was left to starve to death hidden under the floorboards when the gnolls overran it and was trapped and died; and a vampire gnoll [[Ancient Akeer Vampire Gnoll]] can be freed as well.
