## Swamp
The swamp is mainly home to Stilt Town, a town that is run by the crocodile [[Thousand Teeth]] and his crocodiles and Lizardfolk. They are allowed to exist within Zatma County, acting autonomously. There are no efforts to displace the peaceful community and the Count of Zatma has an agreement with the crocodile government of the town to abscond with choice goods, blame it on piracy, and take it into Zatma before the Town of Prest can receive the goods. 

A green hag resides here, [[Bella Frogwife]], who wants to feed on people who wander into the swamp. 

### Settlement
- L: Stilts Town, technically within the territory of the Count of Prest who is sworn to the Duke of Siblune
