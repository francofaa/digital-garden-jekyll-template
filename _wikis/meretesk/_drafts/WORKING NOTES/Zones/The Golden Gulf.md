## The Golden Gulf
Lots of stuff on the sea! Shipwrecks abound with violent creatures but great treasures to recover. A haunted lighthouse peers over the edge of Kraya County. The merrows have a feeding ground, and a Ghost Ship haunts the seas as well.

The Ghost Ship is piloted by the ghosts of adventurers who came to fight alongside the [[Sleeper Queen]] against the Salt King. Their ship sank at [[Last Light]] before they were able to land. 

Nominally a possession of the crown, [[Alfil Island]] is run by a community of pirates with an uneasy truce with local sahuagin and merfolk. The pirates run the community as a true democracy and it is a strangely just and fair land, though it has a zero tolerance policy and temporary banishment is common for breaking the strict rules of the island. 

In spite of its well-run structure, it is thought to be a horrible, lawless land.

Last Light is the last island before entering the Golden Gulf. A small community of outlaws who sell supplies. Nominally owned by the Crown, the community manages itself. 

The Cave of the [[Sea Fury Scylla]] is found in the depths of the Gulf. She does not like guests.
