Many soldiers of the March escort **foreign caravans** into the City of **Gomotesk**, causing many goods from the west to be very costly due to the tariff that **Kriska** takes. 

The **Cadaver Collector** cleans up the battlefields of the western marches while the humanoids and gnolls fight against one another. The Cadaver Collector was an ancient construct that was made by the **Salt King** 700 years ago. It still collects bodies to this day. The souls are lost and retrieving the souls from the Collector is something that every warband and unit seeks to do. 

If the Salt King or a necromancer were ever to claim this cadaver collector, they would be able to use the captured souls to create an **undead army**. 

The Gnolls group themselves into **warbands** and often compete with each other for lands and resources, allowing the patrols to keep them in line. The gnolls consider Kriska Fortress to be the greatest prize due to its position as a rest stop for **caravans**. Some of the gnoll warbands have engaged in **necromancy** and **sorcery** to achieve these aims.

# 14 Salt Flats

The Salt Flats are an expansive desert where **salt harvesters** and **scientists** from far and wide visit to harvest salt and conduct experiments, respectively. 

**Flamingos** travel here from **Taruna Lake** to feast on **purple grubs**. Feeding on these grubs turns their **feathers purple**, which is a draw for some adventurers seeking to make some money off of the feathers. When the bird is killed, there is a 30 second window before the color is drained from the feather when a preservative can be used to freeze the pigmentation loss. 

A **purple worm** lives underground, which is where these grubs are coming from. 

A **festival** is held here once a year called **Burning Lich** where the effigy of a lich is burned to celebrate the destruction of the **Salt King** 700 years ago. Some say, however, that the Salt King still sleeps beneath the salt. 

## **Special Effect:** *Saltwind*. 
Supernaturally powerful winds, a salt wind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to salt and grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes **1d4**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

Saltwind leaves **4d6**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) or ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check or Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)) check allows a character to recognize a saltwind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A saltwind typically lasts **1d4**![](moz-extension://e205630e-d562-9e4f-b51e-f25eb4a1b8f4/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) × 10 hours.
