## Dungeon Delving
- **Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight** and even modern infantry doesn't conduct operations at night. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.
- **Time-keeping device:** Measure the amount of time they are in the dungeon. Use 1d6 where every activity is 10 minutes and every die is one hour. From 6 to 1, their torch burns out. Other taxing conditions can take effect (cold, heat, magical effects, etc)
- Each time the dice timer advances, there is a **1/6 chance an encounter is triggered**. 
- Rations, water, torches! **Torches last 1 hour**
