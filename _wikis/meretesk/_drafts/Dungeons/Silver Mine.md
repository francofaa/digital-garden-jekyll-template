# Approach
The road lifts high up as you approach the entrance of the [[Silver Mine|Silver Mines]] and [[Silver Town]]

# Hook
Blikz's cousin **Johnny** Jutran tells Blikz that there is something going on in the mines, that people have been coming back changed. The goblins are refusing to go back to work and some of them have gone feral, lashing out and attacking people.

When the heroes arrive, Johnny takes them up the path to go to the goblin town first, via a footpath above the mine entrance. 

Arriving in Silver Town, the heroes will hear of a contract on finding the source of the infestation and ways to stop it. 

When the heroes arrive, there will be a human miner who has fallen victim to this, and the goblins claim that it is a curse. The military officer here who rules over Silver Town, Commander **Tenfa**, has finally started to take it seriously. 

The heroes will be able to enter the dungeon either through the front entrance of the mine via Silver Town, or down via the elevator (which closes above you, a **sophisticated metal gate** that closes like a camera shutter.) 

The goblins will be excited to see Blikz. 

A goblin alchemist named **Morgamelly** says that she can find a cure but the **inoculations** using the spores from the victims have not been sufficient. "I need something deeper. If you can find the heart of whatever is infecting people and bring it to me, I can surely put something together in a few hours."

**Grayjaw**, the goblin chieftain, says that there is a curse on the mine because king's people have delved too deep. 

**Bourbon Maduro** is also down here in the mines, having taken a military contract to investigate and determine what the goblins have done: "They told me that the goblins had something to do with this spreading fungus, that they summoned this creature to take it over and kill the kings' men. All I want is the cash and if the commander wants her criminal, I'll hand it over."

```ad-history

The fungal infestation began in the level below after a delve into the mine ordered by **Victor**, the lord regent for the boy king **Tiros**. He was desperate for more silver to spend on his own lavish expenses. 


```

```ad-loot
- Spore Heart (to cure brooding spores)
- 20 sp worth of silver ore 
- 5000 sp worth of silver ore
- 100 feet of rope
- buckets
- pickaxes
- 1 stick goblin dynamite
- 4 rocks of devils ore 
- 5 lesser healing potions
- Blood Lantern
- Breaking Spear

**Reward**
- 3,000 gp from the military outpost 
- 200 gp from the citizens of Goblin Town

**Milestone**
Curing the brooding spores.
```

```ad-note
title: The Brooding Spores

Creatures that touch or breathe in spores on an infected creature or corpse must make a **DC 10 CON save**. On a success, the creature cannot be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature has the **brooding sickness**.

The saving throw is repeated every 24 hours. On a success, the creature is immune to the brooding sickness for another 24 hours and is no longer affected. On **three** successive failures, the creature **dies**.

Upon infection, the victim has yellow sclera and a severe itching sensation. The fungus smells good to the creature and they feel compelled to **eat** it. 

After the first failed save after 24 hours, **fungal growths** form on the skin and the desire to eat more fungus becomes overwhelming. A **DC 10 wisdom saving throw** is required to stop from trying to consume more of the fungus. Consuming more of the fungus will result in the creature having disadvantage on its next save for saving against the infection.

After the second failed save after 48 hours, the creature becomes weaker and slower, weighed down by the mass of fungal growths on its body. Its speed is reduced by 10 feet. 

After the third failed save after 72 hours, the creature dies and becomes a **spore servant**.

The cure can be developed by bringing the heart of the Brooding Mother in **13**. 

```


# 1 Elevator room

```ad-note
title: The Goblin Gate

Once the heroes enter the dungeon, the goblins will shut the way back up to the goblin village levels.

The gate is etched with silver runes declaring the identity of the king who commissioned this gate: 

> I, King Ragrat the Mighty, Ordered the Making of these Nine Gates of Silverdeep and the Making of the Great Lift

The ninth gate opens into the [[Ancient Lab]] while the first gate opens out into the Silver Mountains.

An ancient gravitational magic powers the elevator.

```

> A large elevator is in the center of this chamber. The way up is open but you can see goblin guards patrolling up there. Below, the elevator descends further into a pit. 

In the crevices of the cavern, there are pick axes left discarded and weary workers ready to go home.

When the heroes enter here, two of the workers become **spore servants** and begin to attack, starting with the other workers, who try to flee. 

Investigating the corpses will reveal that there were fungal growths on their heads. Touching any of these may result in contracting the **brooding spores**.

Going into **9**, **3**, **4**, requires bypassing or disabling **Bourbon Maduro's** traps. 

```ad-danger
title: Bourbon's Bear Traps

The bear traps have a +8 to hit and a deal 1d10 piercing damage on a it. Creatures hit by the trap have their speed reduced to 0 while in the trap. 

Once triggered, the trap requires a DC 15 strength check (not save) to break it open.

A DC 10 thieves tool check will disable it and a DC 10 perception check will reveal it. 


```

To the northeast, there is a secret door at the end of a silver vein. It can be revealed by investigating it closely. 

**Raw silver ore** can be looted from every vein in this room. It can refined to yield 200 sp worth of raw silver. 

**Below**, the heroes can take the elevator down to **II.1.**, the [[Abandoned Goblin Mine]]. 



# 2 Main Mining Operation
A large rectangular room with mining equipment: 

- 100 feet of rope
- Buckets
- Pickaxes
- Helmets

There are **five violet fungus** in the veins of this room. More fungus ripples out around the **secret door** to **1.** **Two gas spores** flank the entrance to **9.** 

Here a corpse can be found, not an infected one, but a foreman with a pickaxe in his skull. On his body can be found a note, instructing him to evacuate the dwarves and humans but allow the goblins to keep working "because the mine must keep running."

```ad-Secrets
The foreman was murdered by one of the goblins. He fled to the room **5a** to escape the infections. He found the foreman's note and ran to the rooms. 
```

# 3 Counting Room and Armory
A counter in the back. The weapons are covered in fungus and touching them risks contracting the **brooding spore**. There are three dwarves here, **completely covered in fungus**, eating the fungus from the wall. "It's so good!" they cry out. "I don't know what everyone is so worried about."

Returning to the room, the three dwarves become **three spore carriers**, heavily armed (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744317-husk-zombie-burster). 

# 4 Failed Delve
An earlier failed delve shows signs of overly difficult metal to dig through. **Goblin dynamite** is here. It is made using guano from **Silver Peak** above the **Cave of the Oracle**. Two of the sticks are too damp to use from the cave damp, but one is usable.

```ad-note
title: Goblin Dynamite 

As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by **1d6** and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative.
```

# 5 Overnight Bunks

Each of the four rooms has four sets of bunk beds. 

## 5a
There is a goblin miner **Zag** here who is slowly succumbing to the fungus. He asks to be killed. He tells a story of going into the water caverns to hunt baby cave fishers. "Their blood catches fire, and makes a greenish flame."

This blood can be used to burn through the fungal infection in **12**.

If pressed, he may confess to the murder of the foreman in **2.** "But we had nothing to do with summoning anything! I swear!"

## 5b
Room is boarded up. **Four spore servants** https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17395-duergar-spore-servant and **two gas spores** are here. 

Strength check DC 15 to pull the boards apart. 

## 5c
Room is boarded up. **Two spore servants** https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17395-duergar-spore-servant and **four gas spores** are here. 

Strength check DC 15 to pull the boards apart. 

## 5d
Four dwarvish miners are packing up, getting ready to leave. Two of them have yellow sclera and are scratching their skin on their way out. Behind one of the bunks is the fungus spreading across the wall. 

# 6 Hook Cavern

Baby cave fishers dwell here, zooming around the ground, skittering into **7** when people approach.

There is a silver vein in the back of the room.

Otherwise, the room is empty. 

# 7 Water Cavern
A **cave fisher** hunts prey here. Heroes coming up for air will be attacked by the creature hanging from the ceiling above.

# 8 Open Cavern Gallery
The newest part of the mine, beginning in an open cavern. There are five **chitines** posted up here, and there is webbing everywhere, causing a difficult terrain. 

There is a slope down to **II.12** to the [[Abandoned Goblin Mine]]. 

# 9 Equipment Room
This room is not covered by fungus at all. There are webbings everywhere. Six goblins and two dwarves can be rescued from webbings. 

There are lanterns scattered around here and oil. 

There is also a crate with **5 lesser healing potions**.

# 10 Heavily Infested Vein

**Ten infected dwarves** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33277-yellow-musk-zombie) are going through the motions of mining here. As soon as the heroes arrive, they attack them and will pursue them from room to room until they are handled. 

Before the heroes arrive, the **infected** are staring at a lantern filled with blood. This is the **Blood Lantern**. A light burns within it and casts an eerie dark red glow. It boils when it is surrounded by the undead infected dwarves. 

A dead fairy is among the infected. 

One of the infected dwarves has the **Breaking Spear** in his stomach. 

```ad-Secrets
title: Blood Lantern and Breaking Spear

The Blood Lantern and Breaking Spear were brought by a fairy warrior of the Cold Prince who came to investigate the Brooding Mother. 

An investigation will reveal that it is a fairy item. It can only be used by a creature with fey ancestry.

**Blood Lantern**
When a creature is within the lantern's light, the blood within will boil if the creature is undead, celestial, fiend, or fey.

**Breaking Spear**
If you throw this spear as a missile, you may use a bonus action to recall it, if you are within the thrown range. If the spear hit when it was initially thrown and you use the bonus action to recall it, the spear inflicts its weapon damage as it removes itself from the target. 
```

# 11 Fungal Pathway
The way the fungus got in. This room is barred by a fungal mass that will spray acid if the heroes try to attempt to touch it or destroy it. Every creature within 30 feet must make a **DC 12 dexterity saving throw** or take **2d6 acid damage and be infected by the brooding spores**. 

The fungus can only be destroyed by the flammable blood of a cave fisher or by using the dynamite.

Through the pathway there are **five frail humanoid creatures** (that do not seem to be previously dwarves or other humanoids) that are covered in a fine dust (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17399-bridesmaid-of-zuggtmoy). They emerge from the yellowish fungal growths that completely carpet this room.

They will travel down the fungal growths, luring the heroes deeper into the cavern to **12.**


# 12 Fungal Nest
The **Brooding Mother** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17407-yestabrod) 

In this fungal nest, the heroes can find **4 rocks of devils ore** and **hunks of silver ore worth 5,000 sp**

There is a pit leading down to **II.16** [[Abandoned Goblin Mines]]

# Wandering Monster
There is a **choldrith** stalking the halls of the lower mine. Roll **1d10 every hour spent in the caverns. 

**Bourbon Maduro** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744302-blood-hunter) and his team (a Tabaxi wizard, **Whiskey Tips** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/316603-pirate-deck-wizard) and a Kenku bard, **Rummy Alfredo** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979793-kettlesteam-the-kenku)) can also be encountered in a room. Roll **1d10 for every hour spent in the mines.

> Maybe that Morgamelly witch summoned the fungus here. Who can say.
