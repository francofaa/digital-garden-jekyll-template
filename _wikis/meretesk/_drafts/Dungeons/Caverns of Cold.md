```ad-history
Thought to be the birthplace of all goblinkind, the Caverns of Cold are below the final 9th level of Silverdeep. Caves once provided goblin homes and ancient goblin graves are scattered about. There are portals going down but they are sealed (though easily opened by committed adventurers.) These portals have warning signs around them, indicating the fear the ancient goblins had regarding the depths below.

A fey court has since taken over: the Cold Prince and his exiles.
