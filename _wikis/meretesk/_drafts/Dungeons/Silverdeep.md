Silverdeep is a megadungeon of 9 levels. 
```ad-history
Silverdeep is the ancient Goblin complex which was sealed 300 years ago right before the Goblins were finally officially absorbed into the Gomoteski Kingdom officially, after centuries of living under the thumb of the Gomoteski king.

```ad-note
title: The Elevator and the Gates

The gate to each level is openable in the **1** room in each of the dungeons. The gates are sealed down to the [[Ancient Lab]].

The gates effectively, after being opened, act as return tickets to different levels of the megadungeon once they are entered.

The following dungeons do not have a gate and are not accessible by the elevator: 

- [[Caverns of Cold]]
- [[Living Tunnels]]
- [[Ancient Aquifer]]
- [[The Veins of Hell]]

The gate is etched with silver runes declaring the identity of the king who commissioned this gate: 

> I, King Ragrat the Mighty, Ordered the Making of these Nine Gates of Silverdeep and the Making of the Great Lift

An ancient gravitational magic powers the lift up and down.

```ad-Secrets
After Balhannoth was unleashed in the **Living Tunnels**, the goblins sealed Silverdeep out of an abundance of caution.
