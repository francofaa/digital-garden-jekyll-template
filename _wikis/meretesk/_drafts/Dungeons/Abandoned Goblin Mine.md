```ad-history
An abandoned goblin mine that has recently restarted operations. 

```


# 1 Original Mine
The elevator shaft is closed shut beneath and above. There is a notch in the wall, **a panel**, that an **elevator key** can be slotted into.

Ancient graffiti here indicates ancient goblin presence. **Six darklings** live here. They act hostile at first but can be reasoned with. They say they were banished centuries past and were formerly the Cold Prince's followers. Leaving him, they were cursed with light sensitivity. 

In the southern part of this room are the new delvings into the mine. New wood has been placed on the ground for flooring but there are signs of a struggle: A dwarf corpse is found with its head ripped off. A DC 15 perception check will reveal footprints going to **5**.


# 2 Room Name
A crumbling floor requires a DC 20 perception check to detect and a DC 15 dexterity saving throw to avoid falling 10 feet into the pit, causing the creature to sustain 2d6 bludgeoning fall damage. 

**Four maw demons** live in this pit and will attack a creature falling in here. 


# 3 Altar of the First Delver, Hargun
An arrangement of **four rubies worth 1,000 gp** total is upon the altar. Disturbing them summons a **wraith** and **2 specters**. The doors magically seal shut but the hallway back out to **2** is still open.

Killing the wraith will cause it to drop the **bracers of archery** and **circlet of blasting** from its form (which it was previously wearing on its body).

The wraith cannot leave the room but the specters will continue to hunt the heroes down. 

# 4 Cubby 
A party of five miners, two goblins among them and three dwarves, are holed up here with little food. They have barred the doors, so pushing the doors open will require a DC 10 strength check to shove open. The doors are also locked.

The miners warn the heroes against disturbing anything here.

Inside there are ritual items (**silver comb worth 5 gp**, sticks of incense that smell like cinnamon) and shamanic vestments, likely used to honor ancestors. 

The miners say that they barely escaped with their lives and have been holed up here for days. 

There is also a scroll here with the names of the first delvers, called "The companions of Hargun, whose names must be remembered for all time."


# 5 Hall of Shrines

This hallway of shrines honors the original delvers of the mine. Their names are broken over the archways: 

1. Grim ->  G\_\_m
2. Ungliss -> \_\_gliss 
3. Trista -> Tr\_\_ta
4. Borok -> B\_\_\_k
5. Frinny -> \_r\_nny
6. Tagrat -> \_\_grat 

Completing their names by etching them puts them to rest. Otherwise, disturbing their graves results in **6 specters** appearing.

Upon their graves are **artifacts** (silver goblets, gems, silver plates and mirrors) worth **100 gp per grave**. 

If these are disturbed, the specter whose goods were disturbed will hunt the heroes. 

# 6 Old Counting Room 
A room with empty shelves and drawers, picked through in a hurry. Spiderwebs cover everything and a thin layer of dust. A corpse, partially eaten, can be found here. This room is completely abandoned. Going west out to the new mining excursion reveals bloody drag marks. 

# 7 Foreman's Room

Can be accessed via **15**. The doors out to **6** and **8** are both ajar. Within, a **ghoul** is feasting on a corpse. 

An **elevator key** can be found on the bookshelf. 

The bed is completely decayed. An empty oil lantern can be found. 
- A book is here as well, seemingly a diary, per the name on the front cover, but the pages have been eaten away by small creatures. 
- An ink well, run dry, is here too
- and a broken quill made from a cave fisher bone. 

# 8 Spiral Staircase room going down
A gang of **three ghouls** led by a **ghast** is here, looking for corpses and live meat to eat. 

# 9 Choldrith Nest
**1 choldrith** is here. Its mate went above to the [[Silver Mine]]. It will be behind the stalagmite

# 10 Chitine Nest
**7 chitines** are here, exploring the space. They will flee if half of their number goes down and will lure the heroes into **9**.

# 11 New Mine 
A massive mining excursion connects the Brood nest to the rest of the old mine. **10 infected miners** (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33277-yellow-musk-zombie) can be found here, goblins, dwarves, and humans. 

# 12 Scalloped Room
Shelves of rock lead down from the [[Silver Mine]] above. Here there is a lone **chitine**, hiding in the shadows. It will flee if the heroes approach, leading them to **10.**

# 13 Small room
A small room where it appears old materials were kept. Things made of leather are here, which have been chewed through by the ghouls elsewhere in the dungeon. 

# 14 Grand Hall
Bones are scattered among the tables here and **eight skeletons** will animate if the heroes disturb the table setting. If the table setting is disturbed, the skeletons will rise and the foreman will appear between the tables. The ghost of the foreman is a **Phantom Warrior** and perceives you as a threat. 

The table contains plates, goblets of silver, worth 10 gp total.

This was once the grand hall of the goblins, a place of celebration and mealtime between mining shifts. It is now defended by the ghost of the foreman, who wishes to protect his workers' mealtime.

# 15 Vestibule and Stairs

A staircase going down to [[Abandoned Prison and Barracks]]. A gang of 3 ghouls led by a ghast is here. They are looking for corpses and live meat to feed upon. 

There is a secret door leading to **7**. It can be found by taking the doorknob from the door beside it and pushing it in. Removing the doorknob from the other door turns it into a wall. 

# 16 Spore Tunnel

There are **10 brides of zuggtmoy** lurking here. They appear to be protecting an egg. 

A secret door covered by fungus leading to **3** can also be found. The fungus can be burned away with cave fisher blood or dynamite.
