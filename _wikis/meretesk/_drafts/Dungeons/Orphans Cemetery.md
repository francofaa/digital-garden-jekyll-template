Vampiric Mind Flayer

Destroy the vampire

- Necklace of three skulls. A trio of skulls that bicker while you sleep. Only you can understand them. The necklace has 1 charge per skull which is expended forever and can be used to cast speak with dead.

# Hook
In the City, a dead vampire is found staked. Brannifer comes to Buck, sweating and transforming into a vampire spawn. He says he has to stake him before it's too late. "The vampire was hunting me down. It was smart, wicked smart. But something's gotta be done before more of these things come. It was wearing old clothes, like from a hundred years ago. Way out of style."
