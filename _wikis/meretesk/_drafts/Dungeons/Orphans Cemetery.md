# Hook
In the City, a dead vampire is found staked. Brannifer comes to Buck, sweating and transforming into a vampire spawn. He says he has to stake him before it's too late. "The vampire was hunting me down. She was smart, wicked smart. But something's gotta be done before more of these things come. She was wearing old clothes, like from a hundred years ago. Way out of style."


```ad-history
This was once a crypt for the illustrious **Casadar Family**. A **priest of the Unseen** lived on the premises behind the chapel.

**Yelena** was an **old lover of the Duke's** (whom she refers to as the **Duke of Visigoara**). She was near death when the duke saved her by transforming her into a vampire (though she had been buried before she could escape). The Duke tired of her, and that is when she began **feeding on workers in the catacombs**. 

The crypts and catacombs were **abandoned** after the attacks and **sealed**. It was turned into a cemetery for orphans. 

Yelena was recently **awoken by grave robbers** who delved too deep. Yelena **spent 100 years excavating** a small crack for herself to **escape** through. She emerges at night and goes into Meretesk, **turning into mist**. 

After the crash of the **mindflayer bioship** 10 years ago, the mind flayers have emerged and grown, heading to the **deadgod** to **implant the elder brain** into its head. They started the **cult** as well for this purpose. 

A mindflayer left behind was **fed upon by Yelena**, inadvertently turning the creature into a **vampiric mindflayer**. She began avoiding the creature. 

```
