- Feather pen. Write in the air with the pen and break it. Mending it will cause the pen to spell out the message. 
- Blindfold. If a creature is wearing this item over their eyes, they see invisible things but not visible things. As a bonus action, if the creature is wearing this item on their head, they may lift or pull down the blindfold. Otherwise, it requires an action to put on the blindfold. 
- Shadow Heart: Slaying Selawynn imbues your focus with Void energy: +1 casting focus, requires attunement, attunement can only be removed with greater restoration (behaves like a curse). Selawynn's grace: Once per long rest, when you would suffer damage, you may instead teleport 60 feet to a unoccupied square that is in darkness.
