# Session 1
## Intros
### Helewynn
Helewynn walks her Nan through town to the Shrine of the Shadowbound. Selawynn is well-respected, even by the town guards who pay her deference. She sings to the passersby and they stop and greet her, offering her food and copper coins. 

"To our ancestor who consumed the shadow that we wield today."

### Skadi and Mike
Skadi and ??? are in celestial class (Hespero doesn't teach it, doesn't speak it, doesn't like it) but the tutor [[Muzzy]] has some other people in the class. 

(They are worshippers of the deadgod, call themselves deadheads but no one ever comes back alive, It is an honor to die as the god did). 5 page essay of your choice of topic, roll +int to get your grade, regardless you are fluent. 

Fisk, Prim, and Luger are the three deadheads in the class. They are all from the Grimewater.

On their way to meet Hespero, the two run into a military procession with a shipment to the mint (the soldier looks down on mikes char who is a simple town guard)

*What kind of weapon do you wear and where did you get it?*

### Blikz
Blikz goes to pick up his payment for a different bounty: A bandit who had killed and robbed a traveling family. Blikz was able to track him down after he found all three of his fellows standing with a gut wound. Blikz collected the body and presents it now to [[Bertrand]], the quartermaster, at the barracks. Blikz is offered 5 gp, much less than the stated bounty of 25 gp, "Which was for all six of them. I should really give this guy the money. Take it or leave it."

Three bandits are left in the wilderness and can be found if taking the sea route, on a raft heading upriver.

At the barracks, he sees the soldier hanged. "The Void! It will come for us all!"

## Hook
Hespero summons them all to a taverna to eat lunch and discuss an exploration of the glass tower
- There is a valuable book there: The wizard's notes about other planes. Pick up anything else that seems valuable too and I might buy it off you. 
- I will pay you 200 gp for the book.
- Offers ??? access to the arcane library to learn more about the world at large

## Diverging Paths
### Upriver
Traveling upriver, you can observe three bandits (2 bandits, 1 thug) on the shore. They are wearing the same stolen armor that the bounty Blikz found was wearing. 

### Through the Snarlwood
Two Satyrs approach the heroes, asking if they want to get drunk with them. If the heroes accept, they start playing target practice with them. 

### By the Silver Mines Road
Walking up the road, at dusk, the heroes pass a group of miners going home. 3 Wolves attack the heroes

### Southern Snarlwood
On the outskirts of the abandoned village, the heroes are attacked by a single ghoul
