# Hespero's Past

The Burr, a fiendish creature from 300 years ago, once resided in Meretesk. The Burr worked together with the Lich of the Godsbody. 

He was destroyed by 

- A halfling [[Wynnfry]] who bound the shadows of the Lich inside of herself and passed on the Void curse
- A high elf from the Feywild [[Hastryg]]
- An unknown commoner from the farm around the abandoned village (killed). His wife and children departed east to farmlands around the Merry River.
- A goblin king (killed): [[Ragrat the Martyr]]. The monarchy was subsequently eliminated after the unfair treaty that the King of [[Gomotesk]] forced Ragrat's son [[Unblart the Unready]]. Infighting resulted in a non-hereditary chiefdom, unseating Ragrat and Unblart's [[Grimstar Dynasty]].
- Mallory Whisperbottom betrayed the party in order to get more information on the book he was working on

The abandoned village [[Blight Town]] is where the battle took place and why the village is destroyed.
