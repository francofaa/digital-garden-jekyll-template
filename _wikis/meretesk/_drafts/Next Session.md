# Bourbon and his team 

Bourbon comes to the team very Sick with his companions also sick. He says they were sent by someone to retrieve a note and destroy and that was it. Nothing about a fungus. He thinks he was slick using a servant but I recognized the man. The nobles think we don’t notice things. It was a servant I have seen with insert noble name here ice things. It was a servant I have seen before serving the man

If Bourbon reads the letter, he realizes that they would never have gotten the money and would have been killed. 

gives a hook on the nobles being shitty

# The fairy in the 10 miner cave
fairy in the caverns says we know what you did skadi (or he has a charm or a note that reads "Skadi" with a crude sketch of her)

# Loose Ends and Rumors
Dont forget about the elves hunting the heroes for killing the lion; also think about how the hunters in the woods are going to become more brazen and hunt more in the snarlwood 

Don’t forget about helewynn being haunted by the dusk hag 

buck not being there means that the vampire thing started happening 






- [x] **HOW DOES BUCK GET TO THE DUNGEON???** 
- [ ] Boss battles need to have minions!!!







When the heroes clear everything in a ring, tell them rumors / explicit information about everything that is in the ring

[[Rumors]]

[[Townies]]

- The cargo that Helewynn and Blikz recovered was devils ore. The soldier was convinced by the deathless one to bring it to him but this was necromantic material that was recovered from the mines that the military wanted to investigate to see if it had any military application. 
- HOOK: The captain gets corrupted by the devils ore! The heroes have to cure him!

# Most important
- [x]  Design the mine dungeon! This is abso-fruitly crucial
- [x] Design Abandoned Goblin Mine
- [x] Make the randomizer program!
- [ ] Plan out the rumor mill for each of the quests 
- [x] Figure out loot, treasures, and milestones!!!



Loose threads: 
- The deadheads (what would they tell Buck?)
- The telescope: What is Hespero doing with it?
- The Elves: Will they be hunting down the heroes? 
- Snallygaster: She is haunting Helewynn (maybe the only way to get rid of the curse is to get help from Brangwen but this transfers it to Selawynn)
   - Snallygaster is looking for Helewynn because **she is haunting Snallygaster too!** Due to Helewynn's void curse



5. find a way to work in the multiverse crossover stuff without having them go to the 13 islands or argot or whatever; make that all in their face and accessible

12. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggvvktDFMSE
13. Rumors for the rings of regions for the heroes to search for knowledge 
14. Make some information treasure (for Buck's interest in arcane stuff)
15. make a duck themed magical weapon, add more Shop of Wonders magic items

- Buck will go talk to the deadheads to get info
- Blikz will talk to Johnny to figure out what he wants (refer to a contract from the king as well)
- Helewynn, stops by the hospital in the Wash to help out, and then the next hospital
- figure out what snallygaster's deal is 
- dark shadows

Whenever the heroes decide to rest, they will see a parade of ghosts walking down past their campsite. 


Returning to Hespero, on the way to turn in the book

*Buck is confronted by a town guard [[Gert]] who calls him new meat even though he's been working for a year (he says that he spends too much time with Hespero who is a bad guy and thinks he's better than other people, and that he spends too much time with criminals).

> Hey new meat. Where you going? 

*Stefano, a nicer town guard, pushes Gert away and tells him to keep it down and assures Buck that he's just ribbing him.*

have the barge back to me by the festival 

------------



*Three bandits are left in the wilderness and can be found if taking the sea route, on a raft heading upriver.*

At the barracks, he sees the soldier hanged. "The Void! It will come for us all!"
