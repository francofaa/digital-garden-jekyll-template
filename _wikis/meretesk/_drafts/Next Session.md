THINGS I GOTTA DO FOR THIS CAMPAIGN: 

1. flesh out the quests and monsters 
2. nail down every single npc and their motivations
3. flesh out the other dungeons 
4. Set up the rumor mill as they continue to level up and have to spread out 
5. find a way to work in the multiverse crossover stuff without having them go to the 13 islands or argot or whatever; make that all in their face and accessible 
6. clean up all these obsidian notes to make it easier to figure out and find the right notes
7. Consolidate all the monsters and stuff you want to use 
8. Figure out where the secret notes and lore public notes go
9. Make some treasure! for later! (and the milestones!)

Returning to Hespero, on the way to turn in the book

*Buck is confronted by a town guard [[Gert]] who calls him new meat even though he's been working for a year (he says that he spends too much time with Hespero who is a bad guy and thinks he's better than other people, and that he spends too much time with criminals).

> Hey new meat. Where you going? 

*Stefano, a nicer town guard, pushes Gert away and tells him to keep it down and assures Buck that he's just ribbing him.*

have the barge back to me by the festival

*Three bandits are left in the wilderness and can be found if taking the sea route, on a raft heading upriver.*

At the barracks, he sees the soldier hanged. "The Void! It will come for us all!"



## Diverging Paths

Traveling upriver, you can observe three bandits (2 bandits, 1 thug) on the shore. They are wearing the same stolen armor that the bounty Blikz found was wearing. 

### Through the Snarlwood
Two Satyrs approach the heroes, asking if they want to get drunk with them. If the heroes accept, they start playing target practice with them. 

### By the Silver Mines Road
Walking up the road, at dusk, the heroes pass a group of miners going home. 3 Wolves attack the heroes

### Southern Snarlwood
On the outskirts of the abandoned village, the heroes are attacked by a single ghoul
