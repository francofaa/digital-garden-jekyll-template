The heroes must solve a mystery where a member of Helewynn's family was killed and drained, lured away somewhere. The clues should point the heroes to the person who has been kidnapping the people for the Vampire Duke. They can then be led to the vampire of the orphans cemetery. There should be an additional murder / kidnap. 

Clues: Not all should be obvious. 

Murder: Investigation. There was a murder. Who was the victim? Tease out clues. Give enough information to start the quest. 

Setting the scene. Quest delivery. Getting brought to a person who is tasking the heroes with the murder investigation. 

Maybe it is a minor noble. Enlisting help. No trust for the town guard or the military. 

- Time of death
- Body discovered, to be buried at sunset. 
- Witnesses

Litter the areas with clues. Start with the murder. 

Second-hand information. Every clue should link a piece of info together. 

Name *locations* and populate them with *clues*. Add some other locations with some clues and red herrings

Table of clues. Start with the place with most clues. 

Narrow things down for the players

Have clues connect to other new locations and have the locations point to one another
