# History
2000 years ago the god fell on the mountain, disturbing the giants who lived there. They began being born and the giants that live there believe that they arrived on the godsbody. 

1400 years ago the Vampire Lord tricked the dragon Balaur into sleep and he maintains this sleeping spell. The Salt King sought to end the spell. 

Meretesk is founded 1000 years ago

700 years ago: the Salt King and Sleeper Queen reigned their regions (south of Taruna and Taruna respectively). The Salt King waged a war against the Sleeper Queen who reigned over Taruna. The Sleeper Queen was an ancient sapphire dragon who was also a shape-changer 

Adventurers were summoned from around the known world to the Sleeper Queen's aid. A band of powerful adventurers arrived after the death of the Sleeper Queen in her tomb. They trapped the Salt King in a tomb and turned his realm to salt using magic. 

To stop the Salt King from using the many-bodied tome to become many-bodied, Wynnfry absorbed the Void energy that he had consumed and turned him back into a normal lich. 

He was destroyed by 

- A halfling [[Wynnfry]] who bound the shadows of the Lich inside of herself and passed on the Void curse
- A high elf from the Feywild [[Hastryg]]
- An unknown commoner from the farm around the abandoned village (killed). His wife and children departed east to farmlands around the Merry River.
- A goblin king (killed): [[Ragrat the Martyr]]. The monarchy was subsequently eliminated after the unfair treaty that the King of [[Kingdom of Gomotesk]] forced Ragrat's son [[Unblart the Unready]]. Infighting resulted in a non-hereditary chiefdom, unseating Ragrat and Unblart's [[Grimstar Dynasty]].
- Mallory Whisperbottom betrayed the party in order to get more information on the book he was working on

Taruna underwent a tumultuous time. 

100 years ago the giants came down into the valley to overrun it after the Frost Giants finally dominated the Stone Giants, due to something awakening in the Godsbody. This is when the Cult of the Deadgod began.

Siblune Kingdom is absorbed 400 years ago. Visigoara's union with Gomotesk was the beginning of the Kingdom (600 years ago). 

100 years before, a large army of gnolls overran Siblune Castle and conquered it. Ghosts haunt it now after infighting led the gnolls to abandon it. 

Gomotesk conquered the crownlands, Meretesk.
