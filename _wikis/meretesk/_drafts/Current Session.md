*Buck is confronted by a town guard [[Gert]] who calls him new meat even though he's been working for a year (he says that he spends too much time with Hespero who is a bad guy and thinks he's better than other people, and that he spends too much time with criminals).

# Set-up for Quest 1: Tower of Glass
## Intros
### Helewynn

Helewynn walks her Nan through town to the Shrine of the Shadowbound. Selawynn is well-respected, even by the town guards who pay her deference. She sings to the passersby and they stop and greet her, offering her food and copper coins.

"You're taking care of yourself?"

The winding streets go through the slums: some homes have walls of mud brick or wood, but most are canvas and poles. People walk barefoot in the muddy streets. But people chat and eat, some mull around, but they are snapped out of their misery when Selawynn and you walk by. Selawynn begins to sing. 

- Do you sing with Selawynn?

The people of Grimewater follow in her wake, singing along, beating on drums and playing flutes, and strumming harps and lyres that they've learned how to play on so well they can account for broken and untunable strings.

"I hope you remember the people of Grimewater. These are your people. Keep them in your heart. They keep you in theirs, even if they don't always show it."

You reach the shrine, followed by cousins and aunts and uncles who are not related to you by blood, but you know them like family. You and Selawynn step up to the ancestor shrine, up a small set of worn stone stairs. At the top, there is a broken stone niche with a stone statue inside. In front of the statue is a bowl that is empty. The features of the statue are weathered away, the face unrecognizable, but it is your ancestor, [[Wynnfry]], the first shadow sorcerer who died 300 years ago. A flower crown is placed on the blank-faced figure's head. 

Selawynn places a copper coin in the bowl. "To our ancestor who consumed the shadow that we wield today."

Your 13-year-old "cousin" Rosaline comes up to you and asks if you're going on an adventure soon. Hespero summoned you to lunch to discuss a job. 

"Sounds cool!"

You know that she is the shrine's attendant and puts flower crowns on the statue. She is dressed in her uniform: long dingy white robe with red-tipped sleeves. It is the cheapest color after all. You also know that she takes the coppers. It is an open secret but Selawynn tells her to do it.

"Good luck. You always make me proud."

### Skadi and Buck
Skadi and Buck are in the basement of a pub in the Anvil Quarter where the language classes are held. You and three other students sit in a circle around the teacher. 

> Muzmuzax is an 8 foot tall creature that looks like a green mound of sea anemone. They have orange eyes and contain an unknowable darkness within.

Buck, after being in class with Muzmuzax for a year, you finally managed to find some information about this creature. 

Skadi and Buck are in celestial class (Hespero doesn't teach it, doesn't speak it, doesn't like it) but the tutor [[Muzmuzax]] has some other people in the class. 

(They are worshippers of the deadgod, call themselves deadheads but no one ever comes back alive, It is an honor to die as the god did). 5 page essay of your choice of topic, roll +int to get your grade, regardless you are fluent. 

Fisk, Prim, and Luger are the three deadheads in the class. They are all from the Grimewater. They have never tried to convert you to their religion, thinking of you as unworthy of the truth of the deadgod. They call their god, however, the Divine Fallen, and themselves the Diviners. 

On their way to meet Hespero, the two run into a military procession with a shipment to the mint (the soldier looks down on mikes char who is a simple town guard)

*What kind of weapon do you wear and where did you get it?*

Buck is confronted by a town guard [[Gert]] who calls him new meat even though he's been working for a year (he says that he spends too much time with Hespero who is a bad guy and thinks he's better than other people, and that he spends too much time with criminals).

> Hey new meat. Where you going? 

Stefano, a nicer town guard, pushes Gert away and tells him to keep it down and assures Buck that he's just ribbing him.


### Blikz
Blikz goes to pick up his payment for a different bounty: 

A bandit who had killed and robbed a traveling family. Blikz was able to track him down after he found all three of his fellows standing with a gut wound.

Blikz, you captured a bandit, who you are parading through the streets right now on the way to the military quarter. As you wait your turn at the entrance, where the guards, as usual, confiscate your weapons, you see a multi-mustachioed dwarf retrieving his great-axe. You know him as Bourbon Maduro. His mustaches are dyed blue and his beard is dyed red. 

> Blikz, a few more pennies for you, lad? Be better off going back to fixing mining equipment for my Pa at this rate. Like a true descendant of the Grimstar Goblin should. 

Bourbon just turned in a counterfeiter named Baxter.

The Grimstar Goblin was a pseudo-historical pseudo-mythical goblin who witnessed the fall of the god into the mountain. His kingdom once spanned all three mountains but those tunnels are lost and forgotten now and no longer connect the mountains to one another. 

You find yourself before [[Bertrand]], the quartermaster, at the barracks, having handed over the bounty to a guard. Blikz is offered 5 gp, much less than the stated bounty of 25 gp, "Which was for all six of them. I should really give this guy the money. Take it or leave it. I appreciate what you did by recovering that cargo, but I'm no charity, Blikz."

*Three bandits are left in the wilderness and can be found if taking the sea route, on a raft heading upriver.*

At the barracks, he sees the soldier hanged. "The Void! It will come for us all!"

## Hook
Hespero summons them all to a taverna to eat lunch and discuss an exploration of the glass tower
- There is a valuable book there: The wizard's notes about other planes. Pick up anything else that seems valuable too and I might buy it off you. 
- I will pay you 200 gp for the book called "Interpretations of the Many-Bodied"
- Offers Buck access to the arcane library to learn more about the world at large

## Diverging Paths
### Upriver
Traveling upriver, you can observe three bandits (2 bandits, 1 thug) on the shore. They are wearing the same stolen armor that the bounty Blikz found was wearing. 

### Through the Snarlwood
Two Satyrs approach the heroes, asking if they want to get drunk with them. If the heroes accept, they start playing target practice with them. 

### By the Silver Mines Road
Walking up the road, at dusk, the heroes pass a group of miners going home. 3 Wolves attack the heroes

### Southern Snarlwood
On the outskirts of the abandoned village, the heroes are attacked by a single ghoul 


# Tower of Glass
Whenever the heroes decide to rest, they will see a parade of ghosts walking down past their campsite.
