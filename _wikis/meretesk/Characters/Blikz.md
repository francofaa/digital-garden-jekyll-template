title: Blikz
---

A Goblin from [[Goblin Town]] who works as a bounty hunter.

Has a strong rivalry with [[Bourbon Maduro]], a dwarf with many mustaches.

Befriended [[Helewynn]] on a job. 

> A defecting soldier stole precious cargo from the [[Military Quarter]]. Blikz tracked the soldier down to Sidicea, a city on the other side of the Golden Gulf. After a harrowing journey aboard a hijacked vessel piloted by Helewynn, the two captured the soldier and secured the cargo. Helewynn smuggled the two out of Sidicea and back up the [[Merry River]] where they collected the bounty. They never found out what was in the package.
