title: Gomotesk deified ancestors
---

The people of the [[Kingdom of Gomotesk]] traditionally venerated their ancestors alongside [[Gomotesk housegods]] and other more powerful deities. 

Ancestor shrines would be created in homes or in designated areas set aside for this purpose (such as lichfields, which can be found in [[Meretesk]]). Traditions varied from family to family but most often included visiting the shrine on feast days, holidays, days important to the family, or times of contemplation. Veneration could include rituals like lighting candles, offering sacrifices like food or drink, burning written prayers, singing, playing music, and so on.
