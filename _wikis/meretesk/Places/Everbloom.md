title: Everbloom
---

Named for the tree in [[Persephones Park]] that is always in bloom.

Everbloom is divided in three: 
- A sliver just west of the [[Theatre District]] (the Artists' Corner)
- North and west of the park (Old Everbloom or North Everbloom, or just Everbloom)
- South of the park (South Everbloom)

People of Old Everbloom look down on those in South Everbloom (as upstarts) and the Artists' Corner (as artists).
