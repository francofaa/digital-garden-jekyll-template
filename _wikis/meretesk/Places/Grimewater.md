title: Grimewater
---

A slum on the southern bank of the [[Merry River]]. It is called the Grimewater for the unpotable water due to the runoff from the canals [[The Bend and the Bow]], fed into by the dye producers of the [[Painted Ward]], the laundries (which use urine and harsh chemicals) of [[The Wash]], and the blood and excrement from [[The Squeals]]. 

People of the Grimewater who cannot afford the bathhouses of nearby neighborhoods travel a long distance to bathe upriver of where the dumping starts, but there are malicious classist rumors that the people there bathe in filth.

It is home to the [[Shrine of the Shadowbound]], among other ancestor shrines.
