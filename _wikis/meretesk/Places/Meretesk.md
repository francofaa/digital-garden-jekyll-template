Meretesk is a town subject to the King of Gomotesk and run by the [[Meretesk Town Council]] and a mostly ceremonial rotating [[Mayor of Meretesk]] chosen by lot. It spans the [[Merry River]] across three bridges.
  
There is a wealthy sorcerer named [[Hespero of Meretesk]] who lives in a nice part of town. He is known to be a collector of magical artifacts.

It is a medium-sized town, population around 50,000, no city walls to speak of, and is mostly single level homes, no apartment blocks. The tallest buildings would be religious buildings. There would be a few taverns, baths, temples, and other places of interest. Most people know each other.

Its major industries are
- Silver mining
- Silk farming
- Dye harvesting

Meretesk also produces luxury fabrics and exclusively provides the royal family of Gomotesk with purple dye harvested from the [[merry snails]] that live in [[Mudflats]]
