Design situations, not plots 

For any given problem in an adventure, prep one solution and allow for players to come up with their own

But for any chokepoint problem (a problem that has to be overcome for the adventure to continue), include three possible ways to success. For any conclusion you want the players to reach, include three clues 

Your villains must have objectives. The objective could be something as simple as "Maintain the status quo" or "Stay on this guard rotation". 

Don't plan for specific contingencies 

Toolkit: 
- personnel
- equipment 
- physical locations 
- information 

End every session by asking what the group wants to do next

Villains 

Have them do a lot of things off screen and send a lot of minions after the heroes 

Make a lot of villains, don't get attached to any of them as the big villain. If the one you had set up as the big villain dies, then the next one that makes sense becomes the big villain! No lie! Antagonism is a many headed beast. Violence has consequences 

Villains will probably run away

Three clues to the solution. Inundate the heroes with clues. Give them more leads. Treat the clues as a safety net and not as a constraint. 

Write out each conclusion you want the players to reach per mystery. List every clue that would lead them to that conclusion.

Node based design: 

Starting node has three clues, leading to locations A, B, C.

Each node has 1 clue leading to the other two nodes. (For example, A has a clue leading to B and another clue leading to C). 

This can be made more complex by adding more nodes and having those nodes point to different nodes: https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8015/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-6-alternative-node-design 

Or the nodes can all lead to a destination (which can then further lead to even more nodes)

Types of nodes: 

https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8049/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-9-types-of-nodes

- Locations
- People 
- Organizations 
- Events 
- Activity (something the PC's themselves have to do)

Five node mysteries 

# Overworld Map Design
Information that the heroes have about the world is imperfect. 

- River communities (rivers systems are transpo highways)
- Aquifers and water sources
- Mining, ores
- Fossil fuels
- Leyline intersections
- Mana crystal mines
- Magic mushroom forests

How do these interact? For instance, a wizard builds a tower that threatens a druid's grove 

Add adventure sites and settlements in equal numbers. For each settlement, consider 
- trade 
- craft 
- commodity 
- unusual beliefs 
- unique things 

Examples would include tulip / orchid market, people taking a siesta every day. 

With each location, start with a bad status quo.
