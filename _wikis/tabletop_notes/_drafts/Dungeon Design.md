## Quick Build Tips

1. Something old: What was this place used for?
2. Something new: What is happening now that the heroes must solve?
3. Something borrowed: Monsters, characters, treasures, etc that already exist that you know about 
4. Something blue: Something that makes you sad/emotion, something that makes you feel something

Start from the inside out (from the final boss and treasure room to the entrances). Plan set pieces, not puzzles

Dungeon crawling should promote **exploration**. 

# Step By Step

2. region the heroes start in 
3. 3 levels of a megadungeon 
   1. each level should have a theme

      3. monsters, npcs, strangeness, etc
   3. jaquay the dungeon
   4. working way around obstacles 
   5. wandering monster table 
4. layout and inhabitants of the town outside the dungeon
   1. bare bones of a town
   2. rumors
   3. shops
   4. locations that are useful to characters specifically
5. spread out from there
