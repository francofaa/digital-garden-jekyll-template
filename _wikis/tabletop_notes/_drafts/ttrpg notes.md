# Notes 

- Make something that can be played right away. Play it over and over until it feels right 
- Use real things to give momentum to the fictional things (use the stats, the rolls, the timing, the failures, the damage, the armor to drive the fiction)
- play collapses toward the center, down to the “conversation” of the fiction. graceful degradation in case the top layers dont work out
	- topmost layer is the custom moves, playbooks
	- playbooks, character moves, character crap, threats
	- stats dice core moves harm improvement mc moves
	- conversation mc agenda and principle 

## AW’s systems
- timeframes
- structures (fictional causes have real effects, real causes have fictional effects)
- handoffs
- consequences (scopes and scales)
- permissions and expectations 

Build out systems: 

- Harm and healing,
- moves,
- threats
- gear and crap 
- improvement
- playbooks
- moves 

These systems lead to each other. One move leads to another move, but this other move leads to harm and healing, but this third movel eads to improvement. 

## Starting

- Think of the game’s genre , mood , feeling 
- think of the game’s character
