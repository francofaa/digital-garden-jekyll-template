# Character Creation
1. Choose or roll your ability scores (bonuses and defenses) by adding 3 points and subtracting 1 point or rolling 1d4 in order to add or subtract each point and assigning a number to each of the abilities. 
2. Roll for your grit (hit protection) and flesh (wounds) by rolling 1d8, 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's, or rolling 2d4. 
3. Choose or roll 1d6 by 1d8 for 2 backgrounds and receive the starting equipment for both backgrounds. 
4. Choose or roll *n*d20 for adventuring equipment up to your maximum inventory load (equal to your strength defense).
5. Choose or roll for your character traits and relationships by rolling 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, and 1d20. 

These steps are described in more detail below. 

**Optional rule: Starting at level 0**
1. Roll 1d8 for your flesh points. You have 0 grit.
2. Your stats all start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
3. You start with 2 days' worth of rations, 2 torches, and 1 weapon of your choice. 
4. Choose or roll for one background
5. When you advance to level 1 after acquiring 100 XP, roll for your stats as above. Additionally, roll 1d8 for your grit. 

## 1. Determining Abilities 
Character abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. All of your ability bonuses start at 0. Distribute 3 ability points to your abilities and then subtract 1 point from your abilities. Add 10 to get that ability's defense. For example, a strength bonus of +1 is a strength defense of 11. 

**Optional rule: Random ability scores.** This can also be done randomly by rolling 4d4, adding 1 for the first three rolls and subtracting one for the last roll, determining which stat is increased/decreased by assigning the numbers one through four, in order, to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. You may then swap 2 ability bonus scores. 

For example: The first d4 lands on a 3, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The second lands on a 4, so Willpower increases by 1. The third lands on 3 again, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The last lands on 1, so Strength is *decreased* by 1.

Possible arrays starting, not taking into account position of stats, are as follows.
      1. 3, 0, 0, -1
      2. 2, 0, 0, 0
      3. 1, 1, 0, 0
      4. 1, 1, 1, -1

## 2. Determining Secondary Stats

### Hit Protection
Hit protection is split into grit and flesh. Roll 1d8 to find your grit total. Subtract your grit from 9 to get your flesh total. 

**Optional rule: Friendlier HP.** You may also roll 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's or 2d4 to determine the initial grit.

### Derived Stats
Your secondary stats are determined as follows:
   - Max Load = Strength defense
   - Armored defense = Dexterity defense, plus any armor
   - Movement is by default equal to 40 / 120
   - Max Supply = intelligence defense
   - Mana Dice = intelligence bonus
   - Magicked defense = willpower defense, plus any wards
   - Max Attuned items = willpower bonus 
   - Max Retainers = willpower bonus

## 3. Background Starting Gear
You start with 2 backgrounds which inform what you start with on your person. Roll 1d8 and 1d6 and cross reference the numbers to find your background. Roll the two dice again to get your second background. These are failed professions that you endeavored before becoming an adventurer, so treat them as such. 

You get the gear from each background.

Actions performed using skills or tools relevant to a character's background are done at advantage.

**Optional rule: Species traits.** The characters are assumed to be human; however, if the referee allows other non-human species in the game, the player may replace one of the background traits with abilities from their species. Other traits can be created in cooperation with the referee. The referee has final say if the species are appropriate to the setting: 
- **Stone cunning**: You gain tremor sense for *L* x 10 minutes once per day

## Reading a Stat Line
All creatures can be expressed in a single stat line. 

1. L# or \#HD: Indicates level for a player character or retainer / hit dice for monsters
2. HP #(#): Indicates hit points. Parenthetical number represents flesh points, if any.
3. AD # (*armor, if applicable*): Armored Defense stat, followed by any modifying armor pieces
4. MD # (*wards, if applicable*): Magicked Defense stat followed by any modifying wards. 
5. STR # DEX # INT # WIL #: The four ability in a row. Only lists the bonus. Add 10 to get the defense. When a stat line omits the ability, assume that its bonus is 0. 
6. MV # (#): Movement, in feet. The first number is exploration (10 minutes in a dungeon), second number combat movement (10 seconds). Usually omitted if it is 120 (40).
7. Att: Attacks, usually followed by a to-hit bonus, a die (damage), and a parenthetical indicating the weapon, or spell. 
8. Items: List of all items that the creature carries. 
9. *Special ability*: Any additional abilities. Knacks can appear here. Monsters have their abilities here as well. 

**Example:** 

Ogden Dankworth. L2. HP 13(7). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 11. STR 2 DEX 1 INT 1. Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword). Items: crowbar, rope, short sword 1d6, shield ad+1, helmet ad+1, fireball (spellbook), ward md+1. Butcher: When you kill an enemy, you may immediately make another attack

Mind Vampire. 5HD. AD 15. AD 15. MD 15. Str 5, Int 7, Wil 5. Att 1 x +5 2d8 grappling, or disrupt psyche, or drink sapience. Disrupt Psyche: 30' radius, MD save 15 or incapacitated, 2 uses. Drink Sapience: atk + 5, 1 grappled target, drains -1d6 wil.

# Abilities
There are four abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. They each have 2 scores, bonus and defense. The defense is equal to 10 + bonus of that score. For example, a strength bonus of 2 would yield a strength defense of 12.

Each ability has **static** stats, **actions**, and **saves** associated with them. 

Ability scores are capped at +10/def 20.

The abilities are paired in two ways: Strength and Dexterity are the physical abilities; Intelligence and Willpower the mental abilities. Strength and Intelligence are the active abilities; Dexterity and Willpower the defensive abilities. 

## Strength
*Power, heartiness, physicality*

### Static
- **Maximum load**, equal to strength defense

### Actions
- Attacks that are powerful or obvious 
- Feats of strength
- Brawling

### Saves
- Poison
- Disease
- Escaping
- Enduring fatigue
- Non-magical paralysis

## Dexterity
*Finesse, movement, reflexes*

### Static 
- **Armored defense**, equal to dexterity defense plus any armor, or equal to armor only 
- **Movement**
   - All characters start with 40' of combat movement and 120' of exploration movement. Any penalties to dex reduce movement, 5 feet per bonus point.

#### Armored Defense 
Armored defense represents your ability to avoid damage via reflexes, dodging, or just actual armor. It is equal to your dexterity defense and may be modified by light armor, shields, and helmets or replaced entirely by heavy armor (which can still be modified by shields and helmets).

**Optional rule: Role to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's armor defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their armor bonus (*armored defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to attack with.

### Actions
- Attacks that are stealthy or subtle
- Stunts
   - Extinguishing fire
   - Removing acid
   - Doing a backflip
   - Trip
   - Disarm
   - Taking something out of inventory during combat

### Saves
- Escaping
- Dodging

## Intelligence
*Skill, education, common sense*

### Static
- **Maximum supply**, equal to intelligence defense 
- **Mana dice pool,** equal to intelligence bonus

### Actions
- Attacks using magic
- Attacks that are subtle
- Perception
- Deception
- Foraging for food or herbs
- Tinkering
- Lockpicking
- Picking pockets
- Forethought

## Willpower
*Charisma, luck, mental resilience*

### Static 
- **Magicked defense**, equal to willpower defense plus any wards
- **Maximum attuned magic items**, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)
- **Maximum retainers**, in hit dice, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)

#### Magicked Defense
Magicked defense represents your ability to resist spell damage and effects via sheer willpower, blessings, or luck. It is equal to your willpower defense and may be modified by wards.

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's magicked defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their magicked bonus (*magicked defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to cast with.

### Actions
- Influencing
- Intimidation
- Commanding retainers

### Saves
- Magic
- Morale

# Experience and Advancement

## Coins for XP
Recovered treasures can be spent for the coin value in experience. This money should not be spent on usable objects but on special interests: 

1. Carousing
2. Song, Fame, Statues, Paintings. Sponsoring bards and other artists to commemorate you.
3. Religion or Spirituality. Too much donated may cause the gods to pay too much attention to you and not always the god you're looking to appease.
4. Philanthropy
5. Events: races, gladiator shows, duels, masques, festivals, parades, triumphs, jousts, spectacles: you would be sponsoring these things
6. Land / Businesses
7. Training 
8. Hobbies: Animal husbandry, robotics, device creation, languages, brewing, hunting, art, spell research, item creation (smithing, for example).

**Optional rule: Special Interest Bonus and Deficit.** Characters can be rewarded / punished for spending their special interests in certain ways. At the beginning of the game, they can roll or choose their strong interest and weak interest, and apply a bonus and penalty to each, respectively.

For example:
- Strong: Philanthropy (120%)
- Weak: Land / Businesses (80%)

Each population has a limit as to how much can be spent there.

| Community  | Population | GP Limit (1d6 x #) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Thorpe     | 20         | 10                 |
| Hamlet     | 200        | 50                 |
| Village    | 1,000      | 100                |
| Town       | 5,000      | 250                |
| City       | 25,000     | 1,000              |
| Metropolis | > 25,000   | 10,000                   |

The settlements only have so much stuff to give. Any more money spent in these settlements will cause economic ramifications that are better left not explored.

## Advancement
Characters level up to 10. The following table describes the total XP needed at each level: 
| Level | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | 0        |
| 2     | 1000     |
| 3     | 2000     |
| 4     | 4,000    |
| 5     | 8,000    |
| 6     | 16,000   |
| 7     | 32,000   |
| 8     | 64,000   |
| 9     | 120,000  |
| 10    | 240,000  |

1. Increase flesh score by 1.
2. Grit: Roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the value is higher than your maximum HP, this is your new HP. If it is lower or equal, increase HP by 1.
3. You receive 2 improvement points to spend. These improvement points can be used to either increase 1 ability by 2 points or 2 abilities by 1 point each. Improvements spent in this way increase both the bonus and defense of an ability. Abilities cannot be increased beyond +10 / def 20.
   - **Optional rule**: You can spend up to 1 improvement point to instead take a feat. The other improvement point must be used to increase an ability by 1. 

### Knacks
In lieu of a single ability score improvement point, a character may take a knack. Knacks may be invented with collaboration of the referee. Keep in mind the power level of currently available knacks. 

| Knack                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Retirement
At any point, an adventurer is allowed to retire, but this is typically done at 10th level.

Have the character express a fear and a hope for the future. Roll 2d6: On 10+, their hope comes true; 7-9, their fate is mixed. On a 2-6, they should expect the worst.

Their fate should be written on the back of their character sheet. The referee cannot use this character as an NPC against the party and the character cannot return to be played.




# Damage
When a character suffers damage, they may take grit or flesh damage. 

Grit represents to the character near misses, stunning blows, stamina depletion, superficial wounds and bruises, and so on. Once grit is depleted, the character will begin suffering damage to flesh. 

Flesh represents deep wounds, broken bones, internal and external bleeding, and so on. Once flesh is depleted, the character will fall into semi-consciousness. Any subsequent damage will kill the character. 

## Direct Damage
Some damage may bypass grit. Some damage may also outright kill a character. 

### NPC HP
Non-player characters do not distinguish between flesh and grit. Any direct damage instead inflicts triple the damage dice.

### Environmental

All of the following environmental damage (*in its non-magical form*) is considered **direct damage**, bypassing grit: 
- Non-magical fire, 1d6 direct damage
- On fire, 2d6 direct damage per round
- Lava, instant death
- Acid, 1d6 direct damage
- Drowning. Characters can hold their breath for 30 seconds (3 rounds of combat) per point of Strength bonus. After this point, they must make strength saving throws DC 15 every round or die. 
- Freezing water. Characters must make Strength saving throws DC 15 every minute or take 1 direct damage.
- Non-magical lightning, 3d6 direct damage
- Falling, 1d6 direct damage per 10 feet, to a maximum 10d6.
- Poison, direct damage (amount depends on the poison) 

### Ambush damage
If a character is ambushed, the damage is inflicted directly to the flesh points. The damage is the *normal weapon damage*. 

Characters when attacking in the same way *triple the damage dice* because NPCs do not have grit and flesh but one pool of hit protection.

## Death and Saving
Being reduced to 0 flesh points reduces your grit points to 0 (if not already reduced to 0) and requires stabilization within 1 minute or by the end of the combat, whichever is later, or the character dies.

If the character suffers damage while at 0 flesh, they die.

### Stabilization and Injury
An ally may try to stabilize the downed character by rolling an ability check, a spell, using herbs, or some other manner of healing. 

Once stabilized, the character rolls 1d20 on the permanent injury table: 

1. False hope: you're dead (1)
2. Lose a body part (2)
3. Feeble: lose 1d6 str (3-6)
4. Shaky: lose 1d6 dex (7-10)
5. Addled: lose 1d6 int (11-14)
6. Weak: lose 1d6 wil (15-18)
7. Disadvantage on all checks until rested (19)
8. Standing: Instantly heal to 1d8 grit (20)

Unless a 1 was rolled, the character heals to 1 flesh. 

#### Death 
When a character dies, write down their fate on the back of the character sheet. The character sheet may be ritualistically burned, buried, or sent off in a funeral boat later because the player should roll up another character (or ideally have another character waiting in the wings) to get back into the game.

#### Recovering from Injuries
The injuries feeble, shaky, addled, and weak may be removed after a number of weeks equal to the lowest result from rolling a number of d6 equal to character level. 

For example, a level 4 character rolls 4d6, resulting in a 3, 3, 5, and 6. The lowest number is 3, so the character's ability is restored after 3 weeks of rest. 

## Resting


A short rest takes 1 hour. 

A long rest takes 8 hours, 6 of which must be spent asleep. 

| Conditions                                 | Restored Grit | Restored Flesh |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Long rest in town or wilderness, with meal | 100%          | 1              |
| Wilderness, safe short rest                | L x d8 + str  | 0              |
| Short or long rest (with meal) in dungeon  | 1d8 + str     | 0              |

Long rests in a dungeon are inadvisable and are likely to fail. 

Resting must be safe and include food, drink, and (for long rests) sleep. Any interruption removes all benefits. The additional effects of ineffective resting follow: 

- **Hunger**. If characters do not eat in a day, they may not heal after their rests.
- **Sleep deprivation**. After a night of not sleeping, characters must roll at disadvantage until they rest. They do not heal from the rest. 
- **Thirst**. After one day of not drinking, characters must roll at disadvantage until they drink.  They do not heal from the rest. After three days, they must make strength saves every hour DC 15 or die.
