When you have wild visions and impart them to a group of villagers, roll +eerie. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7â€“9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make the group
- bring people forward and deliver them.
- bring forward all their precious things.
- unite and fight for you as a levy (2-harm 0-armor size appropriate).
- fall into an orgy of uninhibited emotion: lamenting, fighting, sharing, celebrating, as you choose. 
- go quietly back to their lives.

On a miss, the mob turns on you.
