[[3240 Charisma]]

When you go into a market looking for something to buy and it's not clear that you should be able to find it easily, roll +common. On 10+ you buy it. 7-9, the Herald picks one:
- It costs 1 wealth more than you thought
- It's not openly for sale, but you can find someone who can lead you to a seller 
- It's not openly for sale, but you can find someone who sold it recently, who may be willing to introduce you to the buyer
- It's not available, but you find something similar 
- It has strings attached

Miss, Herald picks one and it costs 1 additional wealth more.
