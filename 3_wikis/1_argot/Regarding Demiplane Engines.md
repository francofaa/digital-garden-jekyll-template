# Regarding Demiplane Engines

An anonymous 347 page tome filled with diagrams written in Infernal. It is bound in flesh and bound with gut. The pages have claw scratches. 

*Excerpts: *

## Primer

> Demiplane engines are used to keep parts of a plane in a pocket dimension for reference, storage, or long-term infliction of suffering. Conventional demiplanes can be created via powerful spells, but ripping part of a plane into its own demiplane requires immense power and security measures to prevent escape and ensure optimal torture.

## Problems with the modern demiplane engine

> The demiplane engine as it is today is difficult and expensive to maintain. Constant manual intervention is required (manual powering, infusions of exotic elements, standard maintenance). If any of these tasks are inconsistently done, this may result in leaks into the home plane of the demiplane, or even glitches into other dimensions.

## A new way

> In this 347 page treatise I will lay out a new method of designing and implementing demiplane engines without the need for manual intervention that can be left running for up to a millennium!

## Sirablood

> If a direct vein of sirablood is found, a demiplane engine can be powered for centuries without manual work, as long as the sirablood is directly connected to the engine’s fount.

## Keys

> To secure the engine from being powered down, the keys can be bound to objects that can be summoned forth with a command word. It is recommended to create these keys in case the demiplane engine needs to be shut down, and to keep them on the demiplane itself for easy access. It is recommended to keep a back door open for yourself in case of maintenance or if it is desired to directly interface with the victims subjects.
