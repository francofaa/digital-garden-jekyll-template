A role is the purpose of a unit in a stack. See [[Units and Stacks]]. Roles represent the positioning of a unit in an army or fleet. The following are roles: 

- [[Vanguard]]
- [[Center]]
- [[Rearguard]]
- [[Ferry]]

[[Ground Units]] stacks may contain Vanguards, Centers, and Rearguards while [[Sea Units]] stacks contain only Ferries and Centers (representing the units that are being ferried). 

[[Aerial Units]] may be part of a Center of any stack. There are no Aerial Stacks and any Aerial Units that are part of a stack are considered to be grounded.
