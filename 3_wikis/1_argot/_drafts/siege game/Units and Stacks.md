title: Units and Stacks
---
Each block is between 250 and 500 individuals. Blocks can be called **battalions**, **blocks**, or **units**.

Stacks represent a larger force working together. Stacks work differently for each unit type. The ground stacks are the most complex with the vanguard-center-rearguard rules while sea stacks are limited to ferry-center.

Stacks may also be called **legions** since they represent a more fully contingent of troops closer to an army.
