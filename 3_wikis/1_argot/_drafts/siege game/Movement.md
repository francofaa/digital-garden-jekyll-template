title: Movement

The movement unit for the blocks is centimeters. Based on the size and scale of the map, this is what makes the most sense. Even though there are no squares or hexes, we can still use the terminology **spaces**, **centimeters**, **movement** interchangeable. For example, "This unit moves 2 spaces" would be equivalent to "This unit moves 2 centimeters" and "This unit uses 2 movement."

A unit moves up to its movement speed. It may not move after [[Attacking]]. Attacking is the last thing a unit does.
