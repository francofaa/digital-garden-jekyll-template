# The Unspeakable One (Embara)

Three priests stand warming their hands. One woman dressed in red and two men dressed in blue. They each wear white masks. The woman stands with her hands clamped shut over a wrapped parcel. The two men snivel and shiver as you approach.

“Good day! Travelers!”

“Do you wish to get out of this realm as well, travelers? For you are alone, lost. The indifference of the gods is chilling. Only our anger keeps us warm. And this fire.”

“But the five elders have gone underneath, to summon a god to care for us. They are called the Unspeakable One. They read it in the *Interpretations of the Many-Bodied*.”
