## Pre-credits
### Cemetery
Yuki leads the Kaori, Yoshiko, and Ichigo into Old Souls Cemetery to summon a ghost from the shrine to Sakushi. Hotaru tags along to document the ceremony and hopes to find a hot ghost. 

Yuki divines the portents of the night using tarot cards, and then we go ahead: inverted emperor (we’re gonna do a good job), knight of pentacles (it’s nighttime), page of cups (I’m thirsty). 

The gang performs the ritual, using Yuki and Yoshiko’s blood. Meanwhile Hotaru is led astray by a strange old woman who tries to trap her in a tree. Hotaru resists, helped out by Yoshiko, and is aided by her friends (except Yuki who hid). Ichigo smashes the woman in the face and she spins around and the demon possession is gone. Kaori telepathically throws rocks at the woman after the possession is over and knocks her out.

Kaori peeks into the portal and finds a lava river. She throws Tommy, a rock, into the void, and it instantly disintegrates. She reforms Tommy using her telekinetic powers. Now there’s a crystalized hell rock in her inventory. 

The gang raises Sakushi’s corpse from the ground (rather than her ghost). Hotaru instantly imprints on her and wants to be her best friend. Yuki tries to bind the zombie to make her not eat brains. Declares it works once Sakushi turns out to be normal. Sakushi criticizes everyone’s outfits. 

### Shopping montage
Kaori suggests the gang go to Tokyo (ostensibly to meet her boyfriend, but really she wants to fight crime in the subways). The gang instead decides to show Sakushi modern culture by going to the mall (on a school night!) Shopping montage ensues. 

Kaori bought Vantablack nail polish. Yuki got a bird bone charm bracelet for Sakushi to disguise her from witches. Yoshiko suggests Sakushi get a septum piercing. Sakushi is unconvinced. Sakushi emerges from the dressing room wearing two hats and is embarrassed. They ask her about how she died, cruelly and relentlessly with no tact. 

They went to Sbarro’s and gave Sakushi a bad opinion of American food.

### Ichigo’s house
They go to Ichigo’s house. The gang sends selfies to their parents to show that they are OK. Ichigo invites Sakushi to stay with her but Sakushi is scared off by Yoshiko asking her a very rude question. She tried to run away but then Yuki hexed her with a binding spell and now she must stay within 100 feet of any member of the group. 

Begin credits. 

## School day
The gang goes to school and professor Aizawa confronts them about the day’s chemistry test. Yuki had divined herself into upper level courses but is doing poorly because they’re too hard. Sakushi taught herself about the Internet overnight because she doesn’t need to sleep. She also tried to enroll herself into the Daoming Si Academy for Extraordinary Boys and Girls but was rejected and had to enroll into this school. 

### Homeroom
Ichigo tries to study but fails and Sakushi and Yoshiko study together and do very well. Yuki and Kaori do some tarot reading and divined that they would meet two cute boys and that Hotaru has a crush on Sakushi. They decide to hook them up. Then Yuki, Kaori, and Ichigo play poker after Ichigo fails at trying to study. Kaori loses her allowance. Ichigo won one hand and Yuki won two. 

Hotaru sneaks into Aizawa’s room, aided by Upsy the elevator trapping two girls in its gullet. Aizawa goes to help the girls and Hotaru manages to steal and old copy of last year’s chemistry exam. She talks her way out of a confrontation with Aizawa but just blabbing. 

Principal Hayashida announces that there is a monster hunter coming to campus, Chad Williams. He suggests that there have been incidents and leaves upon further questioning by the children. A strange piano sound comes from the music room. “Glee club is at it again.” The gang ignores it, and so does the homeroom teacher, Ms Hasegawa, saying, “That’s Chad’s problem now.”

The gang passes by a mysterious red door. They investigate and find that the mouth of the lion shaped knocker opens up to reveal a strange kitchen surrounded by darkness. Ichigo is saved from being sucked in but Kaori telekinetically pulls in a pot of pasta which inadvertently sucks all of the gang into the room where Mr Gordo is forcing his students to cook pasta perfectly al dente. He has created a hyperbolic time chamber so the children have been in the room for much longer than in the outside world. 

Ichigo pulls out a noodle and tosses it against the wall. It is perfectly al dente. The other children toss their pasta out, in vain. It is not al dente. The gang appears back in the hall way ten seconds later and they move on to art. 

### Art
Mrs Kitsune, a deer, leads the children out to paint on the field near the baseball diamond. Kosuke, the school idol, is playing baseball. Hotaru and Kaori draw portraits of him. Hotaru paints him slightly transparent and Kaori uses leftover noodles from the pasta adventure to act as his hair. 

The gang sees Cadillac Akane putting the moves on Kosuke, and Yuki hexes her to give her a nosebleed. Kosuke then comforts her which makes the gang more upset. Akane later walks by the girls and calls them weird as Hotaru vomits a love potion and Yuki vomits up a sandwich. Yuki gives the sandwich to Sakushi as a weapon. 

Yuki tries to fight Akane’s flunkies, Tomo and Momo, but is restrained. On their way to gym, Yuki throws up another sandwich.

### Gym
Yuki successfully gets out of gym, sitting on the bleachers, after presenting Coach Kabuto Karl with a divined note. Ichigo throws some good pitches, attracting the attention of the boys, including Kosuke. Sakushi hits the ball at Coach Kabuto Karl, putting him out of commission, but this allows the boys to come over and talk to them. 

Kosuke talks to Ichigo about how good she is at baseball. Yuki writes her number on his hand and runs away, and Kaori hits on Kosuke, talking about her boyfriend and how not super attached she was to him. Kosuke gets embarrassed by all the attention and leaves. 

### English
Professor Bartholomew Periwinkle comes out of the flue to teach his kids. Hotaru immediately tries to show off because he is pale by reciting _Jabberwocky_. Kaori tries to recite some Poe, but comes up with random assortments of things related to Poe basically and gets embarrassed. Yoshiko was also into Periwinkle and tried to bargain with Hotaru for the love potion so she could put it in his tea.
