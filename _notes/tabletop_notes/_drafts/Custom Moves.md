## Campaign 1: Desert-World Fun.
Cannon Seige. When you’re acting under fire due to the cannon seige, roll+Sharp instead of +Cool.

Soul Gambling. When you play dice with Pinner, roll+Weird. On a 10+, you win something from him, stakes set beforehand. On a 7–9, you tie. You can go again with raised stakes, or walk away. On a miss, you lose your soul. If you open your mind up to the psychic maelstrom after that, well... it’s hard to stick to the planet without an anchor.

Wolves. When you run from the Vipers on their turf, roll+Sharp instead of +Cool to escape.

Desert Storms. When you endure a storm without shelter, roll+Hard. On a 10+, you weather it, no problem. On a 7–9, the storm takes something from you, or leaves you something. You get to pick, but start the clock. On a miss, you find something bad in the storm. The clock ticks twice.

Storm Clock
0:00: Nothing
6:00: Nothing
9:00: The Wind seems to seize you. You become intrigued by it.
10:00: The Winds become an Augury for you if you endure it. You may Augur while enduring it unprotected.
11:00: The Winds take hold of your spirit. When you see one, you have to Act Under Fire not to enter it.
12:00: The storm takes you. What happens now?

Dealing with Chack. When you read Chack, roll+Hard instead of +Sharp. Chack’s fucking scary.

The Cult. When Coffee’s cult pours at you, they come with psychic pressure and you roll+Weird. On a 10+, you endure, though unpleasantly. On a 7–9, The noise of their minds is distracting. Take -1 forward. On a miss, the noise of their collective mindfuckery is too great. Suffer 2-harm (ap) as they engulf you in their presence.

## Campaign 2: Snowball world, living in Queen Mary's mall.
Attending Court. When you associate with Mary’s court in a social setting, roll+Hot. On a 10+, you impress one of them, and they may help you in the future. On a 7– 9, you impress one of them and offend another. On a 6-, you offend the court, either through disrespect or insufficient grace.

Home Turf. When fighting on home turf, the Mall Rats can appear or disappear on demand, using secret passages and the like. They act with +1-armor and ignore 1-harm.

Fictional Faces. When Solstice is trying to hide her appearance from you, roll+Sharp. On a 10+, you see that she isn’t who she claims to be. On a 7–9, you notice something off, but can’t nail it down. On a 6-, everything is as it appears

Peaceful Resistance. When you try to harm Visage, roll+Hard. On a 10+, no problem, you do it. On a 7–9, you falter: either inflict less harm, or take -1 forward. On a 6-, you become disgusted with your actions.

Aweful Savagery. Skwisgaar can take up to 6-harm, and has 2-armor.

Braving the Blizzard. When you go out into the blizzard, roll+Hard. On a 10+, you survive, unscathed. On a 7–9, you lose something, the GM will tell you what. On a 6-, you become lost in the blizzard—in every sense.

The Eclipse. When you’re exposed with protection to the eclipse, roll+Weird. On a 10+, you resist the influence. On a 7–9, you lose some of yourself in it; lose 1 experience and learn a nasty truth. On a miss, your brain is forced upon the psychic maelstrom, as if you opened your mind and missed.

Bartering with Barker. When you try to cut a deal with Barker or one of their people, name what you’re after and roll+Sharp. On a 10+, you get what you want. On a 7–9, you get screwed over in the deal: either there are strings attached (like the goods are hot), or the thing isn’t as advertised. On a 6-, you get outright robbed.
