# Am I Being Detained?

* Hespero and the heroes are detained at the docks for kidnapping a Mineosi Ambassador
* Hespero is arrested

# Election Eve

After a whirlwind day wherein [[Livius Anastasius Cratius]] was served, [[Hespero]] was arrested, [[Casimir Flüf]] stole a magic earpiece, and you met a mind flayer, you all retired to Abraham’s home on the edge of town.

Abe went a-fishin’, Malbec went a-fulfillin’ his demon contract *(please note that even though Aaron will likely not play for a very long time, you will for sure experience the consequences of his decision)*, and you awoke to a knock at the door. Baltsaros, Abe’s will-they-won’t-they and Hespero’s slave, requests that you come meet with Hespero in jail.


The following happened in an order I am unsure about: 

You entered into the Citadel, the part of Old Town that is surrounded by an anti-magic field. 

You discovered that the Hespero in jail is a doppelgänger who works for Hespero.

You discovered that Polos Devenir, from episode one, Bumpkos Island, is your judge.

After fooling Damfina into thinking that Allegra wants to meet with them at the Mineosi Embassy, the gang went to the embassy disguised as Allegra and a slave. 

The gang stayed behind and spoke to Pinot Merlot, the Mineosi counsel / mind flayer. Merlot suggested that the gang turn on Hespero and provide evidence that he was the mastermind behind the kidnapping.

Sora went to General Leandro’s manor and spotted Allegra. She applied pressure on Leandro to, I believe, support siding with the Werriadi after he is re-elected general. Please remind me on this one.

Livius went to his hearing for possession of magical items. He was let off by Polos since there was already a charge of kidnapping against him and because he made him a sandwich and because he remembered how they got along on Bumpkos.

The gang returned to the jail and talked to Hespero’s doppelgänger again. The doppelgänger told them that they were able to get out, but only after dropping the dime on Malbec. Malbec had found a statute to turn Polos’s property in the city into public land, and Hespero agreed to buy the land at auction and hand it over to Polos in exchange for the charges being dropped. Additionally Polos disbarred Malbec. The gang later sees Polos, seemingly shocked by his own actions. The gang learns that Polos would be subject to abuse of power charges (which carries a possible death sentence) after his term as judge expires. 

You returned to Hespero’s manor, only to find him unconcerned with your case and dismissive of your worries.

For reasons I cannot recall, the gang goes grave digging (for zombie fodder I believe). Unbeknownst to them, they were tailed by Allegra, who attacks them. Sora falls unconscious after a cone of cold strikes the team. Thanks to Livius’s zomboys, however, Allegra is soon turned into zombie fodder herself.

That is where we will return, at night, in the graveyard, with General Leandro’s wife dead in your arms and ready to be turned into a zombie.

Tomorrow is the trial

* The day after tomorrow is the drawing of lots and the casting of votes for the following offices (note that the City Attorney \[vote\] and the Courts \[lot\] have already been selected):
  * 5 Council members, who guide the work of the assembly (lot): 1 year
    * Clerks (lot): 1 year
    * Ambassadors to various nation-states (lot): 1 year
    * 10 Generals (vote): 1 year, can be re-elected (Leandro is likely to be re-elected)
    * 1 Treasurer (vote): 1 year, cannot be re-elected
      * Candidates:
        * Livius Cratius, scholar (yo, what if you had enough zombies to elect you)
        * Calantha Aran, council member (has a gang, surrounded your team on the docks when you returned from Aurochs Island)
* Hespero has no accusations against him
* Hespero also still has the devils ore. You are unaware of his plans for it, other than what you had originally discussed
* The Ambassador does know that you prevented them from acquiring the devils ore
* Pinot Merlot, the Mineosi counsel, has offered to drop charges against you if you flip on Hespero
* Malbec has six weeks before he must complete his ritual to allow Zulon and his devils in for one night

Outline: 

* Abe gets closer to his master's murderer
* The gang goes to trial
* Pinot Merlot reveals his main piece of evidence: a piece of memory from the Ambassador wherein the gang beat the Ambassador up
* Hespero will be testifying against them, as a doppelganger, but the gang refuses to turn on him
* The gang decimates most the witnesses by revealing their perjury
* A pair of wheelbarrows with the Mineosi guards the gang murdered comes up, throwing the trial into chaos
* The gang makes their case, with the help of Taedor's testimony, that by beating the Ambassador, they were saving Fornorio, who was trapped in the hivemind of the Ambassador
* Damfina is dramatically arrested at the end of the trial for possession of a magical item and suspicion of espionage
* "Hespero" is accused of being a doppelganger and a Mineosi sympathizer, since the real Hespero would not help Mineos due to his consistent undermining of their efforts (in particular, the devils ore incident)
* "Hespero" accuses Sora of being a Werriadi spy

  The last thing Owlicious saw was a tiger paw swiping at it, to death
* Trial to reconvene in one week. The gang must bring evidence to corroborate Taedor's story and to solidify the leap made in the trial that the Mineosi were sponsoring the body farming to acquire bodies for the hivemind Ambassadors
* Tomorrow is the drawing of lots and the votes
* 39 days to Zulon's arrival

You all defended yourselves admirably against the arguments of the mind flayer Pinot Merlot. You resisted his appeals to turn on Hespero and poked holes by dismantling each witness's testimony and using the time-honored tool of xenophobia. Public opinion has turned in your favor in this case. 

"Hespero" (really a doppelganger) testifies against you and outs Sora as a spy; however, his identity is thrown into question after the gang suggests that the real Hespero would never side with the Mineosi, given his constant undermining of their position. \
Taedor is brought to the stand and provides testimony regarding the body-farming to shore up the gang's defense that they were rescuing a trapped person, part of the Ambassador hive mind. The gang must bring evidence to corroborate Taedor's story. Trial is reconvening in one week.\
Damfina has been arrested for possessing a magical item and under suspicion of espionage. The city attorney will be further investigating her. 

Owlicious's recon mission ended with him being destroyed by a tiger paw.

# No, you're out of order!

The city attorney Nestor Domorosi and General Leandro are at odds regarding the Mineosi interference into Argotian affairs. Nestor is a Mineosi sympathizer (and likely the reason the Mineosi had standing in Argotian court in the first place).

If the allegations of body farming are true, the Assembly would have to decide on what to do to proceed regarding the Mineosi.

Werriadi ambassador Kaolina Serrat has met with General Leandro. 

Today the Assembly convenes and is the drawing of lots and the votes.

Today Hespero will speak to the Assembly regarding the deal with the Duergar. 

38 days to Zulon's arrival.

# Election Day

* The heroes Gangs of New York some thugs outside the Assembly Hall
* "Hespero" gives an impassioned speech against the Mineosi
* The Werriadi Republic agrees to provide military support against the Mineosi
