# Kodama Charms (All Islands)

The little kodama speaks to you in a ghostly whisper. Its two companions stand behind it. Each of them holds a square stone with a different symbol on it.

> A world you must mend, $ to stitch
>
> To keep us as friends, you scratch our itch:
>
> Blood of the fiend, blood of the witch,
>
> Blood of the beast, blood of the lich,
>
> Blood of the sorrows, blood of the joys,
>
> Till the end of tomorrows, till the end of all noise,
>
> Make this land pure, and hallow the ground,
>
> Return this world to where it was found,
>
> We gift you this charm, to keep you from harm
>
> Now turn back the clock to where next you dock
