title: Sora Nemmonis
---

Sora Nemmonis serves the Werriadi Republic. Nemmonis led a life full of pick pocketing, forgery, and burglary alongside her partner in crime, a male green dragonborn named Kriv. The two hatched a scheme to pull a large heist on the Republic's national treasury 3 decades ago, but the plan went south. Kriv escaped and went dark. Sora, however, was caught.

The federal officer in charge of Sora's arrest was intrigued by her plan. In theory, there would have been no catching or identifying the two of them had Kriv not made a lazy mistake. The planning was clearly Sora's and the folly clearly Kriv's. The officer could clear Sora's name, pin the attempted heist on Kriv, for a favor. In exchange for her freedom, Sora would become a personal aide to the federal officer. She would help him rise through the ranks of the republic. She would be an instrument of his surreptitious machinations.

And so Sora found herself employed as a spy. She helped her new employer rise into further and further power. She stayed out of prison while Kriv rotted in his cell, but in her own way she was a prisoner herself. Her new employer held authority over her head, and as he grew in power so too did his ability to ruin or end her life. She was bound to serve her benefactor, and getting out of that service is the one thing she has been unable to do in this life. But even in her old age she hopes to one day break her chains. (The Criminal Contact feature is actually her spymaster/benefactor she is in service to.)

Most recently, Sora has been sent to Argot to ascertain how to increase the Republic's foothold on Argolos Island. She has no reason to assume a pseudonym as her existence within the Republic is largely off the records thanks to her benefactor. Her only public name is as a traveling bard, and she uses this cover within Argot to carry out her true work.
