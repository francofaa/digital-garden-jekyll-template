# Mind-freaking:

After performing a ritual on the sirablood, injecting a creature with 1 dose sirablood will allow you to have control over it for 1 day per injection after 1 hour of the substance being in the creatureâ€™s system.

Arcana DC 4 + 1 for each day to make sure the victim does not die

Arcana DC 16 + 1 for each day to check if the ritual works. If it does not, the victim instead suffers from the effects of short term madness.

The chance of the creature dying or going mad increases with every dose of sirablood that creature has ever received in its life.

If the creature dies from sirablood poisoning, it returns in 1d4 days as a revenant, knowing that you killed it.
