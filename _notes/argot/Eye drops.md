# Eye drops:

Drop sirablood into your eyes. One drop in each eye will give you advantage on charisma based skill checks until the end of your next long rest. It will make you more attractive to people.

CON save DC 10 + number of days you have ever used sirablood in this way or you go mad (short term madness). (You still get the effects of the drops).
