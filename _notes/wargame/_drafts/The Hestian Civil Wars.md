# The Hestian Civil Wars

The Hestian Civil Wars is a card-driven block war-game based on a fictional backstory I have not fully fleshed out yet.

This is a two player game, with one side controlling the invading Lenisian armies and the other side controlling the defending Hathean and coalition forces. The two sides must win over neutral city-states in order to claim victory over the span of several (like 16?) years (rounds).

## Components

Two 54-card decks with combat cards 

16 influence tokens 

At least 30 blocks representing army units 

Two dice numbered 1 through 3

Two-part map

## How the map works

All land territories are connected by sharing a green border or a black river border. All sea territories are connected by sharing a blue border. Land and sea territories are connected to one another by black lines. 

You may only enter a sea territory from a land territory with a port. You may depart a sea territory onto any land territory. 

There are two locations that are considered “off-map” and for movement purposes are connected to the territories described below:

1. The Bathradi Mercenaries: Connected to two sea territories 
2. The Lenisian Reinforcements: Connected only to one land territory, Kaderessa
3. The Lenisian Navy and Lenisian Reinforcements: Connected to one sea territory

There are 14 locations that can be influenced and contribute to the win condition. They are denoted by the city illustration, corresponding sigil, and red lettering. 

All “off-map” locations, though they may have a sigil to indicate them, do not count as influence locations. 

## Objective

> Have the most active influence tokens on the board during the endgame. 

The endgame is counted as 1 year (round) of play. Endgame is triggered when: 

1. Both of the commander units from a single side are destroyed
2. One side has placed all of their influence tokens, whether active or not
3. Year 5 ends

When one of these conditions is reached, the next year of play is the last year. 

Ties are broken by:
- Most units on the board
- Most unit strength on the board
- Another year of play


## Units 

Each unit has a sigil, strength, border color, and sigil color. 

The sigil and name indicates where the unit can be recruited from. For example, a Hathea levy can only be raised from the territory of Hathea. A Dontari unit can only be raised from the Dontari territory.

The sigil’s color indicates whether the unit can be rallied after it is exhausted. Red sigils cannot be raised again. Black sigils can be raised again. Both sides have four units each that cannot be re-raised from their locations: the two general units and their two elite units. 

Strength is determined by the dots at the top of the unit’s face. A unit is turned or “stepped down” when it is damaged. For example, a Hathea Elites unit starts at 3 strength. If it is hit once, it is turned so that the 2 strength indicator is at the top. 

Naval units only transport and do not take part in combat and therefore do not have a strength marker. 

The border color indicates a unit’s allegiance: red for Hathea, blue for Lenisia, yellow for neutral, and purple for mercenaries. To simulate fog of war, the unit’s face faces the player to whom the unit belongs to while the opponent sees a blank unit. Since the two sides share units (the neutrals and mercenaries), it is important to keep them separated during combat rounds.

### Movement

Armies (composed of 1 or more units) can move across boundaries with the following rules: 

#### Sea Movement
- An army can only embark onto a sea space if
	- it is moving from a port space (denoted by the docks)
	- the number of friendly ships in the sea space outnumbers the number of enemy ships in the sea space
- An army may disembark from a sea space onto any land space
- An army that is disembarking from a sea space onto land must end its movement

#### Boundaries
- Armies cannot move across mountains
- If an army moves across a river, it must end its movement after it crosses

#### Size and Logistics 
- Any number of units constitutes an army 
- An army must move all at once (it may not split its movement across phases)
- An army may choose to not use all of its movement and stop early
- Armies may “drop off” units
- Armies cannot “pick up” units during movement
- Armies of 5 or more units can only move one space per turn
- You are not obligated to move all of the units on a territory
	- If there are 6 units on a territory, and you move 3 of them, you are moving 1 army of 3 units

#### Special Areas
- In the “off-map” territories, each unit is its own army, denoted by the number
	- Therefore the Lenisian sea space is counted as one army: the navy + land unit that can be raised there)
	- The 4 Bathradi Mercenary units that can be raised can move as two armies (but since they are adjacent to sea spaces, require a friendly navy to transport)
	- The Lenisian Reinforcement units are considered as individual armies until coalescing in one space, whereupon they may move as a single army 
- Between Maudret and Zekula, there is a bridge. If you have active influence in both locations, you may move freely between the spaces without incurring the river-crossing penalty. 
- You may move freely between Arkaring and Arhala and between Firukal and Ferespar without requiring the use of naval units. However, you may not move from Arhala to other land territories aside from Arkaring. 

#### Interacting with enemy armies
- If an army enters the space of an enemy army, it must end its movement there

	- Kaderessa
		- Rasser
		- Dadrim

		- Hathea Levy (x3)

## Order of Operations 

At the start of the game, both players start with 7 cards. 

At the start of every subsequent Year, both players discard half their hand, rounding down. They then draw 5 cards and add them to their hands. 

The player with the most uncontested influence tokens on the board face-up gets 1 additional card. 


Bid for 1st position using the following rules: 

1. Each player plays 1 card from their hand
2. The player with the higher number wins
	1. If a player plays a phalanx card, that player may play additional phalanx cards up to 3 to modify their score
	2. If a player plays double envelopment, that player may play additional cards to modify their score
	3. If a player plays Marcus or Lucius, that player may play additional cards to modify their score
	4. If a player plays Hannibal against another commander, that card is worth 4, per the text 
	5. The Lenisian player wins ties

Each year follows the following order:

1. 1st player movement
2. Combat resolution (determined by 1st player)
3. Influence resolution
4. 2nd player movement
5. Combat resolution (determined by 2nd player)
6. Influence resolution

## Activating for movement 

During the movement phase, the player may play 0, 1, or 2 cards facedown and discard them to activate their armies.

- _0 cards: _The player does not move any unit but may discard and draw the same number of cards plus 1
- _1 card:_ The player may activate 3 armies. In lieu of activating an army, the player may **rally** a location
- _2 cards: _The player may activate all of their armies and **rally** only once.

### Movement rules

- Armies of 1-4 units may move 3 spaces
- Armies of 5-6 units may move 2 spaces
- Armies of 7-8 units may move 1 space
- Armies of more than 8 units cannot move (and cannot force march)

#### Forced March

Discarding an  additional card during movement allows for a forced march and the army may move 1 more space even after crossing a river or disembarking from a sea space. 

### Rallying New Units

If on your movement turn, you elect to rally, please adhere to the following rules for rallying troops: 

- Each Lenisian reinforcements space yields 1 unit or 1 unit and 1 naval unit
- Each port yields 1 naval unit
- Each city-state yields 2 units
- Hathea yields 2 units at a time
- Bathradi Mercenaries yields 2 units at a time, but can only be rallied when there is an adjacent navy unit (which then controls that mercenary

**Notes:** 
1. Rallied troops may not be moved on the same turn they are rallied. 
2. If a port is rallied, it may yield 2 army units or 1 naval unit, not both (unless 2 rally points are used). 

## Placing influence

If an army passes through a neutral city-state, the player may place an influence token face-down in the city-state. This is token is considered to not be active until the influence resolution phase.


## Combat Resolution

At the end of the  movement phase, combat is resolved.  The attacking player determines the order in which each combat is resolved. 

Both players play a card from their hand face-down, flip them at the same time, and resolve the text on the card. Both sides then roll their d3 die and add the total to their card. The larger number wins. The losing player loses strength points from its units equal to the difference of the players’ combat scores.

The opponents then play again. 

Combat ends when a player retreats or at least one army is destroyed. 

Both players then discard the played cards and draw back up to the number of cards they played. For every 2 units destroyed, each player draws an additional card. 

### Retreating

If a player flips their card over sideways (or leaves their card face-down) they indicate that they wish to retreat. Combat is resolved as if though the retreating player played a 0 strength card. Both players still roll die to determine casualties. 

The retreating army is then moved *by the winning army* a number of _legal_ spaces based on the following: 

1. Move retreating army 1 space
2. Move retreating army another space for every 2 cards that were played
3. Move retreating army 1 more space if they played all of their cards
4. Move retreating army 1 more space if they played no card in the last turn of combat (see **Retreating with no cards** below)

If there is no _legal_ path for the retreating army to move, the army is destroyed. The winner cannot choose a path to intentionally destroy the losing army if a legal path is available that would not destroy the army. 

Legal paths cannot cross rivers, mountains, sea territories, or enemy armies. Legal paths must end in friendly or neutral territories. 

Another formula would be: 

- 1 space by default
- 1 additional space for every 2 cards played (including the first)
- 1 space if all cards were played 
- 1 space if no card was played in last turn

Examples: 

- 1 card = 1 space 
- 2 cards = 2 spaces
- 3 cards = 2 spaces
- 4 cards = 3 spaces
- 5 cards = 3 spaces
- 5 cards and all cards were used = 4 spaces 
- 5 cards, all cards were used, and attacker played with zero cards = 5 spaces

- 1 card: 1 space
- 1 space for every 2 cards played after 1
- 1 space if all cards were played
- 1 space if attacker plays with no cards 

#### Retreating with no cards

Once the attacking player has exhausted their cards, they are considered to have retreated, even if the defending player has also exhausted their cards.

The attacking player does not roll. The defender rolls their d3 and plays a card, if applicable. (If the defender has a card, they *must* play it). The attacker suffers that number of casualties. The attacker is also moved an additional space. 

#### Both sides retreat

If both sides retreat, resolve combat as normal, with the value of the retreating cards being set to 0. Both sides move 1 space away to a friendly or neutral territory of their choice. 

## Influence Resolution 

Any inactive influence tokens may be flipped to active if: 
- a friendly army is in or next to the city-state and
- there are no enemy armies in an adjacent land territory to the city-state
