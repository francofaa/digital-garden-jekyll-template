# Episode 4: Open wide and Seyoncé
## Cutting class
The chemistry test has just been returned, Sakushi et Yoshiko are off doing alchemy, trying to synthesize the poison. They succeed in replicating it and figuring out the ingredients. It is a toxin found in the blood cherry blossom trees (it blooms once a year with a blood red blossom with cherries that are toxic). The trees are found on Sakushi’s family estate: The Fujiwara estate is now a national park. 

Everyone else just finished up in Mr. Learnbot’s class. Yuki apologies for her outburst by saying that she is on her period. Mr. Learnbot makes her go to the nurse and gets midol. Then school is over.

Sakushi and Yoshiko are doing the potions at her house. Her parents are gone on a trip. It is an old fashioned house with an alchemy corner. There are vintage velvet Lisa Frank posters. 

## The gang makes plans

Hotaru wants to find Sakushi to work on her documentary. She uses Whatsapp to find Sakushi.

Yuki goes out to the park with Genji to snuggle up. 

Everyone else decides to work on their video project. Ichigo wants to film everything until something sticks. Kaori plans to film her project in black in white only with just black. Noir on noir. Hotaru wants to go to the estate to do research for her film “The Mystery of the Crystal Cave.” Everyone remembers that they meant to first try to contact the shrine maiden in the cave for information about the mystery so they plan to meet up again at the mall. 

Yoshiko decides to grab a potion on the go but it explodes.

Yuki kisses her date goodbye and it goes well. Genji texts a heart later. 

## Return to witch mountain

Everyone meets up behind the mall to go up to the crystal shrine. Ichigo sees a good subject for her film and wants to do her project on the old man’s life. She wants to know what his life has been like. He is 120 years old and was born on the Peak of Mt. Fuji. When he was born, a pair of eagles cut the umbilical cord and then the other flew him into the wilderness. The woods raised him. In the 90 years he has been living around the cave, there have been some strange oozes and tentacled monsters and creatures from other dimensions have slipped through. He spends his time healing people. 

Yuki realizes she forgot the ingredients for the seance and runs back to the hot topic to pick up her ingredients and "How to perform a seance in 3 easy steps." or is it "Open Wide and Say Ons" or is it "Open Wide and Seyoncé"

The hermit heals 1 stress for Yoshiko. 

Sakushi remembers that this cave used to be the center of a lot of local mythology. It was a hotspot for supernatural activity. Especially ice type creatures. But this was something that was legend during Sakushi's time and not something that ever was happening. She finds that it is odd that things are happening there again. 

The old man tells them that he can help them tap into the aether. Yuki requests some hair or part of clothes or other personal item in case she ever needs it. At the top of the mountain, everyone finds themselves back in the cave with the corpses still around. Yuki takes what bones she can from the witch in her Hot Topic Bag. 

## In the cave

Ichigo now decides to make a documentary of Hotaru's documentary. (Hotaru is currently taking footage of the cave). Sakushi is getting a little weird and hungry, sniffing Hotaru's hair. Hotaru turns the camera to the maid Tomo (the assassin’s) corpse. 

**\~Seyoncé\~**
"To the left-- of the cave
To the left -- of the cave
Let's get in formation
Form a ring about it
Keep our emotion of love on top
We'll start the countdown
Two making one
Spirit summoned"

Transcriber’s note: SEAN DOESN'T LISTEN TO THE SONGS IN DISNEY MOVIES AND HE HAS BEEN VOTED OFF THE ISLAND.

## Seance tonight, and fight the break of dawn

A ghostly figure emerges from the wall. Hotaru loves it. Akiko, the shrine maiden ghost introduces herself. She used to live on the mountain and then transcended into the spiritual. Kaori wants to catch up with Akiko about rocks. Akiko is scared of Tommy, the hell rock. Akiko says that Tommy's hell energy could summon more monsters and could become sentient. 

They finally ask Akiko if she knows anything about the ritual that took place with Sakushi's family. She examines the corpses after recommending that they return the bodies to the ground. She says that there is great power in recreating scenes like that. 

*Careless whispers plays* it's romantic.

Then they ask about the face stealing spider monsters. Ichigo whips out her trophy head. Akiko recognizes the monster. The demon spider is the spawn of a mother demon spider which is much longer and has several faces. If there are this many years that have passed in the abandoned wing then there is certainly a colony. The girls think that they should tell the demon hunter about it. The masked spiders come from another dimension so as they expand their territory, they stretch out our dimension. 

Hotaru wants to give the ghost a thank you kiss. They have a gentle, not weird lip to lip kiss. With a little lingering. Hotaru has tapped into the aether by channeling the ghost. Hotaru is able to see many ghosts in the room, including the ghosts of Sakushi's family. Yoshiko snaps Hotaru out of it by holding up the face mask. Hotaru yells "You're ruining the moment! Which meant nothing to me."

## The question of the bodies

Yuki texts Genji 2 to ask for him and some of his guy friends to help move the bodies. 

Sakushi knows that they were buried a town over in Rhubarb Town. 

Gen, Gengi 2, Gengi, and Kosuke all show up to help. They are all in disguise, dressed as ZZ Top. Gengi 2 can't resist a call for help from his boo. To try to get them to help Yuki shows them the demon head and tells them that she can show them where the demons are in the school. They agree to help out but find out that Sakushi has been raised from the dead and the bodies are her family. 

Kosuke wants out because he doesn't want to be associated with this. 

Everyone gets ready to move the bodies but Sakushi decides that she wants to revive them. Ideas are thrown around. Like making clones of them Ichigo's house. Or taking them to Ichigo's house and resurrecting them there. But they settle on taking them to the local graveyard to bury them in Sakushi's tomb. They carry the bodies down the mountain.

## A murder most foul

They decide to stick the bodies in large suitcases. Yoshiko and Sakushi watch the bodies while Kaori goes to buy big suitcases with the two other guys. Yuki stops to share a pretzel with Genji 2. Ichigo and Hotaru are also with the bodies, taking goofy pictures with them. Sakushi looks in the parking lot and sees a creepy looking older guy with an old Toyota. She approaches him and charms him, asking him to help her get a cat out of the tree. She sabotages him while he climbs the tree, trying to yank him down as soon as he gets up in the tree. A messy confrontation ensues. And she eats his brains. 

She puts his body into the car. 

While this happens, the gang dresses up the bodies in trench-coats and stuffs them in suitcases. Then Sakushi comes up covered in blood with the stolen car. 

## A rift in the gang
Yuki squeezes Genji’s hand and he pulls away.  She also doesn’t know what is happening so they are still cool. Kaori is a superhero and can’t be seen with all the bodies. Kaori, Yuki, and Hotaru leave with the horrified boys and go to Bobatea Bo-bobatea. 

Kaori chats up Gen and Genji to get some information on Kosuke. She learns that he is trying to win an idol competition as a singer. She tries to get the boys t help talk up her skills to Kosuke and they mention that Kosuke eventually wants to duet with someone famous to launch his own career.  He is potentially interested in superheroes. They are still super freaked out. 

## Trip to Rhubarb Town

In the car, Ichigo listens to TLC and sings along. Sakushi thinks that the music would be fun to have at a party. They are thinking about planning a party for Friday. They drive safely to Rhubarbtown. It is a nice place. They put the bodies back to rest, including the one of the murdered man, as soon as the coast is clear. Sakushi writes a note that says “I did it and I felt so guilty that I set up the greatest mystery of all time” and pins it to the murdered man. 

They wipe the car down extensively. 

## Kissing Coda

Meanwhile Yuki asks Kaori for dating advice and Kaori tells her it is all about kisses (wet, toothy kisses). Yuki by now has much more kissing experience and doesn’t buy. Hotaru is also not buying it and tries to look up Shonen Tsundere even though Kaori reiterates that kissing humans is very different than kissing ghosts.
