## Lunch
Kaori, Ichigo, and Yuki continued their school day at lunch. Hotaru got detention for stealing a test and Yoshiko and Sakushi went off to work on a zombie potion.

Yuki was still crying in the bathrooms after talking to the boys during gym.Angry that no one had come to check on her since her outburst, she tried a big magic spell to create a huge storm. But all that she managed was to make her own personal raincloud that drenched her in the bathroom.

Meanwhile in the cafeteria, Ichigo loaded up on all the calories needed to maintain her athletic frame and ran into Cadillac Akane in the lunch line. Ichigo made a kind of lame joke at Cadillac, but it went OK. 

Kaori saw that Kosuke had set up a receiving table with his flunkies Gen, Genji, and Genji-2. The boys were selling hot model Kosuke merchandise (a calendar) and signing autographs. Kaori grabbed a  seat at the closest table to eavesdrop and watch from afar. Ichigo joined at the table, and Yuki came back from the bathrooms feeling that being soaking wet would get her sufficient attention. (It didn't. No one remembered she had gone off to cry). 

Yuki decided to buy a calendar and was treated very well by Genji-2. Kaori thought it would be cool if Yuki used this connection with Genji-2 and an in with Kosuke's group and as a way to arrange a group date. Yuki liked this idea, now developing a crush on Genji-2 since he had shown her a bit of attention. She lied to Kosuke about why she had given him her number earlier, changing her story to be that she wanted Kosuke to pass her number along to Genji-2.

Ichigo saw Chad Williams in the lunchroom and tried to get some details from him about the monsters that might be in the school, but did not have much luck. Kaori checked out Chad Williams since he was muscular but was grossed out to learn that he was old (36). 

## Detour after computer class
After lunch the gang went to computer class, taught by Professor Learnbot, an AI. Kabuto Ken, Kabuto Karl’s son, showed Kaori a shock website. Yuki spent her time trying to figure out how to make a clone of herself or something. Unclear. 

The gang were on their way to Hyperbolic Math when Ichigo saw a strange ghostly figure with blue hair and different colored eyes. She lost sight of the person but Yuki sensed her trail with her third eye. The trail led upstairs to the abandoned wing of the school. The Goth Club meets on the landing, FYI. The gang talked their way past Genji and Genji-2 who were on hall monitor duty and headed upstairs. 

In the abandoned section odd things began to happen. Ichigo's phone rang and then leaked blood and they saw spiderwebs that they had to cut through. Eventually they heard some unsettling sounds and Kaori and Yuki put a candle on a rock to throw into the darkness. A bunch of spiderwebs caught fire, illuminating some human-body shaped cocoons above.

## Boss fight!
A spider monster wearing the mask of a woman's face appeared. Yuki managed to set up a trap just where the creature was about to land. Its name was Gothora. It landed into Yuki’s trap. Kaori transformed into Princess kNiGht and Ichigo managed a few melee strikes. Kaori tried to bury the monster by bringing down the walls around it, but only managed to cover herself in rubble, triggering her stress explosion, bullying her friends and calling Yuki a crybaby and Ichigo a crappy ninja. Yuki ran off to cry some more. 

Ichigo then called out to Kaori to telekinetically fire a rock toward her, which Ichigo swung at like a baseball. The ball struck the monster, fatally wounding it. Ichigo took the head and mask as a trophy.

Noises started coming from the cocoons and the gang freed the victims of the monster. But upon speaking with the victims, 13 of them, the gang realized they were from different eras, reaching back to the early 1900s. As soon as the victims crossed the threshold of the staircase with them, they disappeared. When the gang turned around to examine the cocoons, there were only skeletons left. 

## Back to class!
With one minute left in math, they went to class to tell their teacher about the dead bodies. But Mr. Gordo didn't care to end class early since they were already dead. Using his hyperbolic time powers, Mr Gordo stretched the class out an extra two hours. Inside the dodecahedron classroom, the students endured the stress of difficult math equations. Ichigo became completely flat, but used the new condition to her benefit as she snuck out of the classroom. 

After math class, the gang finds Chad Williams, but he happened to be in Ms Aizawa’s classroom, the Chemistry classroom and the last class of the day. Everyone tried to tell Chad about the monster, but Ms Aizawa was having none of it and they still had to take their chemistry tests. Yuki got a C+ and Kaori and Ichigo a C-. 

During clubs, Kaori made a bird skull and crystal friendship bracelet to give to Yuki as an apology for her bullying stress explosion. Ichigo ditched her club to follow Chad Williams and Mr. Gordo back into the abandoned wing, where they discussed the possibility of multiple monsters and ghosts at the school.

## Date night

After clubs Yuki got a call from Genji-2 for a group date for karaoke at Boruto Karoake and pizza at Famous American Pizza Time and Ice Cream. Gen and Genji also came to pair with Kaori and Ichigo. They met up at karaoke and sang a Destiny's Child song poorly because all three wanted Beyonce's part. Yuki got overwhelmed and stress fainted. As the gang left, they saw two of their young teachers, Mr Takeda and Ms Hasegawa, seemingly on a date together and slightly intoxicated. 

The date continued with Ichigo carrying Yuki to the pizza place. Kaori ordered squid ink ice cream, but everyone else ordered normal flavors. The other boys got kind of douchey, but Yuki kissed Genji-2 and took him out on a romantic walk in the cemetery. 

## A strange ritual

Kaori and Ichigo abruptly bid farewell to their suitors and followed Yuki and Genji-2 to make sure she was OK. They happened upon a strange cultish ceremony taking place on Sakushi’s grave! They seemed dismayed that nothing they did seemed to work, seemingly because Sakushi’s body was not in the grave. 

Ichigo and Kaori interrupted their ritual, with Yuki helping later. They have detained two of the participants, the leader and a lackey named Yamada.
