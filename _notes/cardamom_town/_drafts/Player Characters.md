### Hotaru Kana
Hotaru Kana moved away 10 years ago and transferred to another school in the big city. There she became a member of the highly exclusive and secretive Kiss A Ghost Club.

Now her parents have moved her back to her old hometown - so she’s a new student at the school, but the players might remember her from primary school. Back in her hometown, she’s determined to find the ghost she saw as a small child. She is a filmmaker and is constantly documenting everything she does with her handcam.

### Maki Yoshiko
An adult who is trying to pass as a student. 

### Kawaii Kaori
Kaori Kawaii is your typical Japanese high school girl. She is a mediocre student who spends her class time doodling names of the cute idol boys onto her papers, fighting with her bratty little brother, and wishing her parents would just GET it. Being goth is not a “phase,” it is a lifestyle! 

One day, after being forced outdoors and into the sun -UGH!- by her parents for a family mountain climbing adventure, Kaori discovered something that would change her life forever. Deciding to ditch her family on the mountain, Kaori went looking for some cool crystals to take back to the Goth club at school (crystals being a vital ingredient into the new dark arts rituals that the goths were trying out). After finding nothing but boring mountain rocks, Kaori spotted the entrance to a creepy looking cave and decided to explore.

Inside, she discovered that she had actually stumbled upon an ancient shrine… filled with dope crystals! While trying to pull one off the ceiling, Kaori slipped and hit her head on part of the shrine, knocking her into the afterlife where she met the spirit of the shrine maiden who used to work at the temple in the sacred cave. 

The shrine maiden liked Kaori and gave her a blessing so that when she returned to the land of the living, she would have the power of telekinesis as long as she promised to use her power for good. Being “good” was harder than Kaori thought, so to make up for the lazy ways she was using her powers (for her chores, to cheat at school), Kaori decided to fulfill her promise to the maiden by becoming Princess kNight, the magical girl superhero who lurks around the Tokyo subway, stopping would-be purse snatchers and litterbugs!

Kaori is still mastering her abilities, and sometimes has difficulty manipulating objects with her powers, unless those objects are rocks! It seems she has an affinity for them after one almost killed her. To make sure she can always protect the streets of Tokyo, she keeps a bag of rocks at her side to use as a weapon. 

The only thing holding her back now is her nosy family! With her parents always inquiring as to where she goes at night, Kaori had come up with the perfect cover story— Shonen Tsundere, a handsome, talented boyfriend that Kaori only wishes were real!

### Hanaka Ichigo
Hanaka Ichigo is the daughter of a scientist mother, and a father from an ancient sect of ninja, where the job is everything. You must have no family and make no real life outside of the clan. But Ichigo’s father decided he didn’t want to be a ninja. In his heart, he was a pacifist, and he left the monastery to pursue life as a comedian. 

It’s where Ichigo gets her sense of humor, no doubt.  Her father changed his name to hide from the ninja, and began working in comedy clubs, where he met his soon to be scientist wife. 
Finding out about his ninja heritage, knowing they must live a life in secret for fear of what the clan would do if ever they were found out, she, a brilliant geneticist who once worked on cloning and breeding extinct animals for an amusement park (a story for another time) made clones of their daughter, Ichigo. 
This proved to be fortuitous, because one night the ninja clan attacked and killed the family...but not before one of the many clones was activated. 

The clones inherited everything about their original, including memories. In fact, the only difference between the original Ichigo and her clones is that all of her clones have black eyes...an unavoidable side effect. Because of this, Ichigo wears dark aviator sunglasses at all times. 

And because she never wants to be caught unawares again, she had taken up the martial art of ninjitsu, while also secretly hoping to use her skills to enact revenge on the ninja clan that murdered her family. 

She is 16, has red hair, and, like her mother, is whip-smart and tall. In her off time she enjoys writing. 

### Sakushi Hyōbu
**Historically Recorded Name**: Sakushi Hyōbu (策士 兵部) meaning Tactician of the Ministry of War (name on her grave)
**Given Name:**Fujiwara no Izumi (藤原 和泉) meaning Spring/Fountain from the  Fujiwara Clan.

**Identifies as Sakushi rather than her actual surname, as that seems to be the case for court ladies of the classical Heian Period. As she's from classical Japan, she's got a way of speaking which would be similar to Shakespearen English in the modern world. So that's something to look forward to.**

Born in the Heian Period in the spring of 975 CE into a lesser branch of the powerful Fujiwara family, whose males occupied most of the highest positions in the imperial government. Her father was an lower middle ranking official in the Hyōbu-shō (兵部省) or Ministry of War.

She would often play war games with her doing father (hence the RPG club), before dying as a young woman (high school age) from an attempt on her father's life through is of poison. Despite his lower rank, he was still a military official, and thus a target for dissidents.

As a skilled poet and author, beloved by her family, she was given a distinguished tomb in the little town that grew into the city where the modern day high school is. I imagine her tomb is something of a local landmark, as no expense was spared by her grieving father before he was transferred to another region. She is the only member of her family to  be buried in this town. Perhaps the landmark quality is why the Goth and Magic User Clubs were drawn to it.

Being raised from the dead, she has tried to adapt to modern life, enjoying some of the freedoms of the modern world when compared to the courtly life she knew in the Heian Period, lax as it may have been due to her father's gentle heart.

She lives in her tomb, spending a lot of the rest of her free time at a manga cafe. She's essentially a cyber-homeless.

I'm addition to reading manga at the cafe, she enjoys writing her own novels and poems, and gardening at her tomb.

She always manages to get her hands on a sizeable Matcha Baguette from the bakery next to the manga cafe, and has been known to whack people with her bread when she's in need of defending herself.

At school, she found enjoyment in the ROG club, which allows her to stretch the militaristic mind and love for "war games" she inherited from her father.

She has brown hair and platinum eyes.
---- 
She is inspired loosely by Murasaki Shikibu, author of arguably the first novel.  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murasaki\_Shikibu] 

Interesting note from the wiki:
In the  [Heian era]  the use of names, insofar as they were recorded, did not follow a modern pattern. A court lady, as well as being known by the title of her own position, if any, took a name referring to the rank or title of a male relative. Thus "Shikibu" is not a modern surname, but refers to  [Shikibu-shō] , the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki's father was a functionary. "Murasaki", an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with  [wisteria] , the meaning of the word *fuji* (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in "Genji". Michinaga mentions the names of several ladies-in-waiting in a 1007 diary entry; one, Fujiwara no Takako (Kyōshi), may be Murasaki's personal name.

It was the custom among aristocrats in those days to call a court lady by a nickname taken from a court office belonging to her father or husband. So, she would identify as her nickname \[Given] \[Paternal Office] or her given name \[Clan] \[Given].

### Yuki Monsuni
    It was dark in the house, like it always was. A small child nested in a nook of a bay window watching the rain fall over the garden. Dirt was piled high and splinters of wood littered the yard, the telling signs of her fathers last eruption. The small girl pulled the blankets tighter around her hear and shoulders and tried to be as out of the way as possible.

    The water was running in the kitchen, only in small little spurts. The child could feel the tension radiating off from her mother even from three rooms away. The barely audible click of her mother's heels on the linoleum floors told the girl her mother was still tip-toeing around the house trying to be as out of the way as possible as well.

    A roar broke the silence, shattered it into a hundred tiny pieces. The girl had seen this before, she knew what was going to happen. Her little brother shot down the stairs, tears already streaming down his face from the beating he knew would be coming. 

"sorrysorrysorrysorrysorry" the young boy cried as he fled to seek safety anywhere in the house. There was no safety to be found in this house.

    The thunderous sound of stomping continued splintering the quiet the house had tried to build. The father of the family was hurtling down the upstairs hallway slinging curses and profanity at the young boy. The girl had heard this all before. There was a strange creak as a large body leaned heavily on the bannister upstairs. It gave way suddenly and unexpectedly, but the girl was not surprised because she had seen this all before.

    One more loud thud, one more disruption of the calm and quiet the house had tried to protect. No one screamed, no one cried in mourning. The father was dead, broke his neck when he landed on the floor. The girl didn't need to get up and look to know this, she had dreamed it earlier in the morning. She counted the times in the day she could have made a change to the dream, altered the reality that was forming around her family now and she winced. A moment of guilt for becoming a monster like her father.

    Three years later the young girl goes to a new school. She is 14 years old and she still has dreams of what to come. Sometimes, she acts to prevent harm or to profit from an opportunity others would have received. She comes from a monster and accepts that she must be a monster too. She keeps her head down most of the time, doesn't really talk to her peers. Her mother and younger brother are happier now. She finds solace that she has been able to give that to them at least.
